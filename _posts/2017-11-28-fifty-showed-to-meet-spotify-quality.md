\-\-- Well, it looks like the [Ministry of Testing -
Boston](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/) isn\'t a
small little group anymore.\
\
Yes, we have 800+ members, but those are just subscribers to our mailing
list, not attendees. I would say we have 30 to 40 regular attendees,
with me defining a \"regular\" as a person who attends one event every
two months.\
\
Tonight, though, was different.\
\
Fifty of fifty-seven people who RSVPed \"YES\" actually attended [Meet a
Quality Coach @
Spotify](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/244512407/).
Which is odd. Like most Meetups, we have a 50% attendance rate. With
free events held right after work, with no penalty for skipping out
after you signed up, the percentage of no-shows are high. With Ministry
of Testing - Boston being in the vein of a work-related networking
group, we get people who may just not have the energy to talk about work
after spending the day at work.\
\
Today, the attendance rate was pretty close to 100%! It was quite
unexpected.\
\
Where the heck did they all come from?\
\
After reviewing the logs, it looks like there was a huge spike in new
membership a week before. Possibly they signed up just for the Spotify
event?\
\
After a bit of searching, I found that the event really hit home with a
lot of Boston event calendars. My [original Ministry of Testing - Boston
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/244512407/) event
posting was mimicked and re-broadcasted by:\

\... Next time, we need to buy more pizza.\
\
Happy Testing!\
