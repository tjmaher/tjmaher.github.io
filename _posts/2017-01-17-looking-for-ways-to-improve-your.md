\-\-- The Ministry of Testing just announced a new product to help
software testers improve their craft: They have distilled their
collective wisdom down into the size of a deck of cards.\

Taken from the [Ministry of Testing Store
site](https://store.ministryoftesting.com/collections/testsphere/products/testsphere-cards-single-deck):\
\
*\"A hundred cards featuring a hundred testing concepts: Heuristics,
Techniques, Feelings, Quality Aspects and Patterns. *\
*\
\"Each card explains the concept with a slogan and three examples that
were designed to have you think about them in different ways.*\
*\
\"Testers brainstorm, coach, share knowledge and share experiences by
using these cards as a conversation starter, a story telling game, a
tool that facilitates workshops and as a guide for their testing
sessions.*\
*\
\"Whether you're a new tester looking for a fun way to learn about
testing or one with many years of experience behind you, TestSphere aims
to unlock barriers that you didn't know were there\".*\
\
The five categories for the cards:\
\

-   **Heuristics**: Possible ways of tackling a problem.
-   **Techniques**: Clever activities we use in our testing to find
    possible problems.
-   **Feelings**: Every feeling that was triggered by your testing
    should be handled as a fact.
-   **Quality Aspects**: Possible aspects of your application that may
    be of interest.
-   **Patterns**: Patterns in our testing, but also patterns that work
    against us, while testing such as Biases.

\
The Ministry of Testing is a software testing group that is heavily
active in the United Kingdom, making inroads in the United States in the
past year, and most recently with the [Ministry of Testing -
Boston](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston) Meetup group,
where I just became co-organizer.\
