### What is Adventures is Automation? 

<div>

My name is T.J. Maher, a Quality Assurance Engineer located in the
Boston area. I\'ve been in the software industry ever since my first
consulting gig testing software at Oracle\'s Waltham, MA office back in
August 1996.

I started this blog last year when I was trying to figure out how to
finally break into the automated testing field. I did a lot of
independent research, came up with code samples, blogged about them
and [posted them online](https://github.com/tjmaher).

When I landed a position as an automation developer at Fitbit-Boston a
few months later testing their eCommerce application, I kept blogging.

I\'m still quite new at automated testing. I find myself challenged
every day, grappling with topics fun but unfamiliar. I\'ve come up with
little side projects every few months to get myself up to speed in
answering questions such as: 

</div>

<div>

-   [How do I come up with browser tests to automate the
    Internet?](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/06/simple-manipulation-of-login-page.html) 
-   [How do I write an automated test
    framework? ](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/12/next-week-automating-amazon-how-i-am.html)
-   [What is API Testing and how do I do
    it?](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/coming-up-how-to-work-with-rest-apis.html) 

</div>

<div>

I have been spending fifty to sixty hours a week this past year learning
this new position, so I tend to write posts randomly and sporadically.
Subscribing would be the easiest way to keep up-to-date with the latest
projects I am working on.
