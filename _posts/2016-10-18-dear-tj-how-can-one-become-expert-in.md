\"I am regular follower of your blog and it has really, really, really
awesome info for testers who wants to move towards automation.*\

\"I would like to know a few things :*\

Dear S.J.,\
\
It is VERY difficult for me to get experience in all of these things.\
\
I am not an expert. I may become an expert if I try real hard for the
next two or three years, but by then, a brand-new automation toolset
will come out, and I will be a newbie, a novice, just like before.\
\
I am still not used to programming. I have only been doing it on-the-job
for two years. There is so much to learn! I always feel like I am about
to drown in all the information that I need to know. Somehow, I have
managed to keep my head above water, and I am very thankful for that.\
\
The reason why my blog jumps from topic to topic is because my job does,
too. A new manager, a new job, a new direction leads to a new automated
toolset to learn. Coming up with sample code for my blog is how I
scramble to catch up.\
\
I have to tell you, I have **never had more fun** in my twenty year
career as I am having right now in my adventure in automation!\
\
I hope you are having fun, too! If we all keep at it enough, one day, we
all will become experts!\
\
As always, Happy Testing!\
