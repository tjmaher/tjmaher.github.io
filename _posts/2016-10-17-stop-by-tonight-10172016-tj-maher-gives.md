\-\-- Tonight, I am giving a talk at the Greater Boston QA and Testing
Meetup. I\'ve been rehearsing all weekend, and I still am not
\"off-book\" yet. Ugh! I hate public speaking, but it is something I
really, really need to learn how to do.\

I\'ll probably just be reading off my speaker notes.\
\
Feel free to view the slides on my SlideShare account at
<http://www.slideshare.net/tjmaher1>.\
\
Unfortunately, SlideShare doesn\'t do animations, so the slides will
look a little crowded.\
\
If I have three bullet points, I usually reveal them one-by-one with
animations\... yeah, that doesn\'t work on SlideShare.\
\
Happy Testing!\
