\-\-- So far, I have been doing well as an automated tester at my job.
I\'ve been doing well picking up Selenium WebDriver, figuring out how to
automate our shopping cart regression tests, adding to the test suite,
and remembering my coursework in Computer Science and Software
Engineering that I studied long, long ago.\
\
\... I was wondering, though: to become more well rounded, should I
pursue working to a goal such as a Java Programming I certification? It
might help force me to learn the real ins and out of the language.\

So, what do you think?\
\
Do you think certifications are a waste of time? That they provide a
good learning tool?\
