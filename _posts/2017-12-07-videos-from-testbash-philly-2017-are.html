<div style="margin-bottom: 16px; padding: 0px;">Couldn't make it to November's TestBash Philly? Videos taken from the conference are now online, posted on the central Ministry of Testing site at <a href="https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/series/testbash-philadelphia-2017">https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/series/testbash-philadelphia-2017</a><br /><br />Although some require a paid Pro subscription to the Testing Dojo, most are accessible with the free Ministry of Testing Dojo subscription. <br /><br /><b>From the Dojo:</b><br /><br />"TestBash Philadelphia 2017 - our third TestBash in the USA was hosted at The Fringe Arts on 9-10th November 2017.<br /><br />"All TestBash events aim to inspire and educate but in equal measure provide lots of opportunities for testers to meet, make friends and continue to build the amazing testing community we have. A big part of that at Philly this year was the first ever TestBash Circus, you can get low-down on this and all the resources to run the circus activities on <a href="https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/series/testbash-circus-activities">The Dojo</a></div><a name='more'></a><br />"We hosted 200 software testers from across the globe, had 10 great talks, lots of awesome 99 second talks and plenty of socials!<br /><br />"We record all our TestBash talks and make them available on The Dojo. Some are free to watch and others require Pro Membership... get stuck in!<br /><br />"Join the discussion about TestBash Philadelphia over at <a href="https://club.ministryoftesting.com/c/testbash/testbash-philadelphia">The Club</a>.<br /><br />"If you would like to attend TestBash or any of our events then please check our latest schedule in our <a href="https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/events">events section</a>".<br /><br />... For previews, take a look what I was live-tweeting on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/11/testbash-philly-day-1.html" target="_blank">Day One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/11/testbash-philly-day-2.html" target="_blank">Day Two</a>.<br /><div style="margin-bottom: 16px; padding: 0px;">My favorites? All of the talks were so good it is difficult to pick favorites. There were talks that surprised me, ones that could be classified as being more related to "soft skills".<br /><br /><b>Ash Coleman</b>, <a href="https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/i-ve-got-a-feeling-ash-coleman">I've Got A Feeling: Thoughts About Myself and The State Of Testing</a></div><ul><li>Ash ( <a href="https://twitter.com/AshColeman30">@ashcoleman30</a> ) talks about being a woman of color in the tech industry, and how your company can become more diverse.</li><li>Ash Coleman and Angie Jones will be hosting TestBash 2018 in San Francisco.</li></ul><br /><b>Christine McGarry</b>, <a href="https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/the-fellowship-of-the-test-christine-mcgarry">The Fellowship of the Test: Building a Community Across Agile Teams</a><br /><ul><li>Christine talks about creating at work "The Fellowship of the Test", a gathering of testers to spark collaboration and communication across multiple project teams. Beware the Technology Thicket!&nbsp;</li></ul><br /><b>Cassandra H. Leung</b>, <a href="https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/how-to-benefit-from-being-uncomfortable-cassandra-h-leung">How to Benefit from Being Uncomfortable</a><br /><ul><li>Cassandra shares her experience with being an introvert, being in uncomfortable situations, and "3 Steps for Proactive Success".&nbsp;</li></ul><b><br />Martin Hynie &amp; Paul Holland</b>, <a href="https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/was-it-something-i-said-martin-hynie-paul-holland">Was It Something I Said?</a><br /><br /><ul><li>Throughout TestBash, Martin &amp; Paul performed skits resembling Key &amp; Peele's "Luther, the Anger Translator", about how to not truly say what you are really thinking.&nbsp;</li><li>On Day 2, they wrap it up with a segment of how to resolve conflicts, and how to communicate effectively.&nbsp;</li></ul><br />I cannot wait until TestBash San Francisco!<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Graphik Meetup, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Happy Testing!</span><br /><br />-T.J.
