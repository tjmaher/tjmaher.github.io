[These past couple of months while I was searching for my next software
testing gig, I strangely found myself with too little hands-on
programming experience. Normally, my degrees and knowledge of the
software development industry would be enough\... but I found out when I
was interviewing that no longer could I as a Software Quality Assurance
Engineer get away with simply documenting test cases in MS Word or MS
Excel. Executing all the test cases by hand just like the end user of
our web or mobile app was not enough. Nowadays, it seems, a QA Engineer
is expected to know how to write automated tests in Selenium with Java
or Python.]{.s1}\

[]{#more}[\
]{.s1}[A QA Engineer was expected to know how to code?\... This, for me,
was scary! ]{.s1}\

[As a manual QA Engineer, in spite of being in the software testing
industry for the past fifteen years, my programming portfolio has been a
bit thin. Even though I have an educational background in programming
and software development, programming hasn't ever been part of my
day-to-day activities. ]{.s1}

[In my career, I have tinkered around a bit. I had used an automated
testing tool called RSW's E-Test Suite, a record-and-playback tool,
using Visual Basic to modify the scripts it produces. I once had an
unpaid summer internship as a web developer writing SQL stored
procedures ]{.s1}when I first entered grad school. I have five years of
experience writing SQL queries, checking that the data being entered in
the web app on the front end is stored correctly on the back-end
database. And I have taken more than a few online courses\... 
:::

[\
]{.s1}[But besides SQL queries, I hadn\'t done coded on daily basis
since 2008. How the heck could I meet the new industry standard?]{.s1}\
[\
]{.s1}Knowing how to code was like the half-remembered Spanish I took in
8th grade. I did very well at the time, but as the years went by, it
became something foreign to me. Only the basics were there. And when I
last studied Java daily, Java 7 and Java 8 hadn\'t been around yet.\
\
[This may seem utterly obvious, but t]{.s1}he only way I have found out
how to code is to actually to code.\
\
There have been roadblocks for me trying to learn how to code. Sometimes
I have been so worked up that I don\'t remember enough information about
programming from my college days, I get trapped passively listening to a
lecture on YouTube. Instead, what I should be doing is typing up the
example code by hand on my own machine at the same time the instructor
in the lecture is typing out an example.\
\
Sometimes, I read other people\'s code samples without trying to type
the code on my own machine and see if I can get it to run. I find that
if I copy-and-paste other people\'s modules, it just doesn\'t stick in
my head. Only by typing all of the code out by hand and playing around
with it do I seem to really understand it.\
\
Sometimes I have been so afraid of writing bad code that doesn\'t work
when I should be telling myself, no, I haven\'t done this in a while, of
course I am going to write bad code that doesn\'t work. With practice, I
might write bad code that works. Then maybe okay code that works
sub-optimally.\
\
The only way to get good at anything isn\'t just doing the research.
It\'s *practice, practice, practice*.

[Before anyone attempts trying to learn automation in Selenium / Java, I
would recommend that QA Engineers who may not have any programming
experience take a course in Java covering the basics. Or maybe even a
regimented online CS-101 Introduction to Computer Programming course
using Java. ]{.s1}If they don't, by the end of any Selenium,/ Java
course they take, the QA Engineer may be able to get an automated test
in Selenium up-and-running, but they might not really understand what is
going on behind the scenes.\

[There are plenty of free resources out there in Java that have given me
a greater understanding of the language. Here are a few resources I have
used: ]{.s1}
:::

-   [Udemy.com offers many free online tutorials in Java covering the
    basics. [[https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?q=java&p=1&price=price-free&view=grid&lang=en]{.s2}](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?q=java&p=1&price=price-free&view=grid&lang=en) .
    Look for one that covers Java 8, the latest version that came out in
    March of 2014, one that talks about using an Integrated Development
    Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or Intellij IDEA. I enjoyed John
    Purcell's course "Java Tutorial for Complete
    Beginners". [[https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/?dtcode=7fbFYzU2xesQ]{.s2}](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/?dtcode=7fbFYzU2xesQ) ...
    While in grad school, I studied Advance Programming in Java 1 & 2
    but that was back in 2008 when we were still using Java 6. A lot of
    new functionality has been added. ]{.s1}

<!-- -->

-   [EdX [[https://www.edx.org/]{.s2}](https://www.edx.org/) has online
    Computer Science classes you can audit for free. They periodically
    offer online classes offered by MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley. ]{.s1}

<!-- -->

-   [A skill that developers have picked up \-- and one I am trying to
    learn myself \-- is how to train yourself from online documentation.
     The latest information isn\'t in a book. It\'s in the online
    documentation that is always updating. Luckily for trying to learn
    developing in Java, we have  Oracle's Java
    Tutorials. [[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/]{.s2}](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) .
    They have different "trails" a beginner can follow: How to get
    started, learning the language, and reviewing what the Java team
    believes is essential. ]{.s1}

<!-- -->

-   [Alan Richardson has a new book out on Amazon.com called **Java for
    Testers**. [[http://www.amazon.com/Java-Testers-Learn-fundamentals-fast-ebook/dp/B00U618KNC]{.s2}](http://www.amazon.com/Java-Testers-Learn-fundamentals-fast-ebook/dp/B00U618KNC) ...
    I first heard about Alan from discovering and taking his online
    Selenium / Java class that is offered at Udemy.com and his website
    Compendium
    Developments [[http://courses.compendiumdev.co.uk/courses/selenium-2-webdriver-with-java]{.s2}](http://courses.compendiumdev.co.uk/courses/selenium-2-webdriver-with-java) ...
    although the course was \$299, I found it to be worthwhile since it
    was so extensive. Alan pulled information from his Selenium / Java
    course into a package called \"The Selenium Clinic\" which won "Best
    Tutorial" when Alan and Simon Stewart --- the creator of Selenium
    WebDriver --- presented it at Eurostar 2012. I purchased the Kindle
    Version of Java for Testers and am still working through the book
    now. ]{.s1}

[Once you get a handle on the basics, you can jump into programming in
Selenium with Java. Even though I have a Bachelors in Computer Science
and a Masters of Software Engineering, when I jumped into courses with
Selenium / Java without knocking the rust off my coding skills with a
Java course, I found myself needing to take a step back to focus on the
basics, too. ]{.s1}
