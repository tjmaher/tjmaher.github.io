\-\-- Are you a Firmware / Embedded Engineer? Fitbit-Boston needs your
help!\
\
From Jason Y. Sproul, Firmware Manager:\
\
\"We have launched a survey and sweepstakes focused on embedded/firmware
test engineers in the Boston area. We want to learn more about the local
job market, talent, and where people work so we can better focus our
recruiting and hiring efforts. We want to build a great firmware test
engineering team alongside our great engineering team.\
