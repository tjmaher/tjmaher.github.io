\-\-- In the April 28th edition of the [Sauce Labs
blog](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2016/04/why-is-manual-qa-still-so-prevalent/),
Joe Nolan ( [\@JoeSolobx](https://twitter.com/JoeSolobx) ) Mobile QA
Team Manager and founder of the DC Software QA and Testing Meetup posted
an article, \"[Why is Manual QA Still So
Prevalent](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2016/04/why-is-manual-qa-still-so-prevalent/)?\"
In the article, Joe argues, \"With the importance of catching bugs
early, and the ability to automate all testing, why do companies and
projects resist the investment in \[Continuous Integration\] and test
automation?\" and talks about an \"automation first\" strategy, building
automation as the product is being built.\
\
Joe then list reasons why not all companies have embraced automation,
such as:\

-   Management \-- except for the QA Manager \-- doesn\'t articulate
    support for automation
-   The development team hasn\'t giving the buy-in to be responsible for
    developing automation as they develop the product
-   The QA Analyst has trouble committing the time to learn automation,
    doesn\'t know where to start learning, and not given a chance to
    apply knowledge once learned.

I agree with these points, especially the last one. After a long career
as a Manual QA Engineer and a newly minted one as an Automation
Developer, I don\'t know how I would have been able to manage in my new
role \-- although I was decade ago \-- had I not finished grad school
for software engineering.\
\
My problem with the article is that I believe a manual tester should
*never* be obsolete!\

\
A Manual QA resource embedded in the DEV team is not simply an extra
pair of eyes on a project. Doing away with the role in a company is a
tragic mistake, silencing the different mindset needed to make a
successful product.\
\
My job as a software tester has always been to act as an end-user
advocate. I provide a voice for customers of the web application that I
am testing. After distilling both the product requirements and the user
interface design into test cases, when I was a manual tester, I used to
execute them using the same tools our customers will use: a keyboard, a
mouse, or fingers on a touchscreen.\
\
A developer\'s main focus is building the thing. A QA Resource\'s job is
understanding all the myriad ways that thing can be used by the
customer, and writing exact steps to test it in kind.\
\
It takes -time- for automation to add their full value, and must be
written, reviewed, and tested. Manual testers embedded in the team as
the product is still in flux aren\'t just a stopgap measure. The work
they do becomes the next automated test.\
