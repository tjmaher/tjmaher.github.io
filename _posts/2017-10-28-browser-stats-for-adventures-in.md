\-\-- To me, the most important metric to me is the **browser - platform
matrix**. Since I consider the QA Engineer\'s primary goal is to operate
a web application exactly as the customer base to see everything as they
see it, I want to know what browsers and platforms are being used.\
\
**Google Analytics** showed me that from Saturday, October 21st to
Friday, October 27th there were 1,176 user sessions. A \"*session*\",
according to Google, is \"the period of time a user is actively engaged
in your website, app, etc\".\
\
With these user sessions, the top ten browsers used were:\

This astonished me.\
\
I keep on thinking that maybe this week MS Edge usage will grow over
time. But, no. It always seems to be Chrome & Firefox which are the top
two. They seem to make up 87% of all readers of this blog.\
\
As a software tester, I usually test in:\
\

-   Chrome, though I probably won\'t find many bugs using that browser
    since that seems to be most developer\'s favorite browser at the
    companies I have worked for.
-   Firefox, a few bugs may creep in, since fewer developers use that.
-   Internet Explorer 11, 10, and 9, depending on what the Product Owner
    wants. Working with healthcare companies or financial firms, you
    will see some old, old browsers
-   Safari on the Mac

\... I never get a chance to test on MS Edge, usually running out of
time. I then get worried, checking the browser stats for the application
I am testing on\... and I find that it is always around two percent of
the population.\
\
What ever happened to Microsoft\'s edge?\
\
\
Happy Testing!\
