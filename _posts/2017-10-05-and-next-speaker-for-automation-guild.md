\-\-- Anybody know how to shoot decent video on an iPhone 6S, how to get
good lighting and sound?\

I just heard back from my favorite software testing podcaster, Joe
Colantonio of [TestTalks.com](http://www.testtalks.com/). I\'ve been
selected to submit a video to his [Automation Guild
2018](https://automationguild.com/)!\

This three day conference is all online, and will be held January 8th to
10th, 2018.\
\
I was going to convert last year\'s talk I gave to the Ministry of
Testing - Boston, [How to Pass a Coding Interview as an Automation
Developer](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/11/video-10172016-how-to-pass-coding.html),
which I based on my [previous TechBeacon
article](http://techbeacon.com/how-pass-coding-interview-automation-developer)\...\
\
\... As you can see in [the talk I gave last
year](https://youtu.be/GIrO8PWTfDc), I have a bit of work to do.\
\
Wish me luck!\
\
Happy Testing!\
