\-\-- Do you have a cool software testing technique that you would like
to share with an appreciative audience? Have you been working with a new
automation tool, and want to share your thoughts about it? Come give a
talk to the [Ministry of Testing -
Boston](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston)! We meet
twice a month all around Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts.\
\
How can you become a speaker for our group? Just ask!\

On [Tuesday, May 2nd, Brian
Jordan](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/238961442/),
formerly from Code.Org talked about techniques used to test the lesson
plans he was generating to allow kids from Kindergarten to Sixth Grade
to learn how to code.\
\
Thank you, Moshe Milman, the COO of
[Applitools](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk13Ucc26mWqI4xvsbO13jw)
for sponsoring that night\'s food and beverage! I still need to confirm
the location for your talk to us in two weeks.\
\
And thank you so much, Tomer from [iZotope](http://izotope.com/) for
letting our group crash at your place once again! If it wasn\'t for you,
we wouldn\'t have a Meetup!\

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first half-hour of every Ministry of Testing - Boston Meetup is a
meet-and-greet, where members can meet fellow software testers where we
can talk about our favorite testing techniques, and network with others
to see if there are job openings.\

**6:00 pm to 7:00 pm: The Main Event**\
\
Brian Jordan, in his talk [Automation Testing for the Non (and future)
coder](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/238961442/),
expanded upon an earlier article he had written, [Robo-Testing your
Website Without Writing
Code](https://medium.com/@bcjordan/using-sweet-robots-to-test-your-websites-%EF%B8%8F-without-writing-code-3ccdb2ae9c67):\
\
*\"In this post you will learn why it's often worth automating your
otherwise manual dev/production build verification tests, how to choose
between \'little to no code\' and \'code-heavy\' options, and---for
\'codeless\' tests---what services are worth taking a look at &
why\". *\
\
Like in his article, Brian went over software testing tools such
as [Testium](https://testim.io/), [Ghost
Inspector](https://ghostinspector.com/) \-- and of course [Applitools
Eyes](https://applitools.com/)! \-- giving demos of each.\
\
By the way, Brian is no longer with Code.org. He is now a game
developer. See, [Clone Drone at the Danger
Zone](http://clonedroneinthedangerzone.com/)!\

### Brian\'s Testing Journey

\
Brian shared with us his testing journey. He wasn\'t a QA Engineer\...
he was Software engineer, learning as he went. When he started on this
quest to create games to teach kids how to code, he started with no
tests and had to build them as he went.\
\

                                                                                                                                                                 \
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[\
When Code.org](http://code.org/) started Brian was working on putting
together a K-12 curriculum. A Non-profit. The classes can be Open
source. Why? \"Every student should have the opportunity to learn\".\
\
Back in 2013 - 2014 when he started the project, \"testing\" involved a
Bug bash: Everyone banging on the site at once. Testing, he knew, was
important:\
\
\

-   Dealing with kids, things will break in interesting ways.
-   If there is a bug in the lesson, you just blocked a whole lesson
    plan.
-   It also needed to work with IE9. Odd windows firewall settings.

\

### ** A Most Curious Bug**

\
Someone had built a lesson plan, a course based on Minecraft. It seemed
to work fine in testing, but when it was shipped to a school. it would
operate fine for a few minutes, and then shut down. They would start up
the program. The browser would shut down. Any browser. Every browser!
The browser would shut down.\
\
Brian had an idea: "Could you go
do [Minecraft.net](http://minecraft.net/)?" The teacher opened up a
browser, and a few minutes after the game loaded up, the browser shut
down. Software operating in the background mistook the course for
Minecraft.\
\

###  How Did They Set Up Tests?

\
Brian talked about how he uses a **behavior driven design** style (bdd)
for the tests.\
\

                                                                                                                                     List tests as Scenarios. How should the software behave?
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We\'ve covered a lot [about BDD in this
blog](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/03/the-differences-between-bdd-and-tdd-is.html).\
\
**How He Originally Wrote Tests**: [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)
using Ruby, mapping out every scenario and how it should behave.\
**Continuous integration solution:** [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/)\
\
\
During their journey they moved:\
\

-   From no automation
-   To test automation 
-   To interactive service test automation.

\

### Non-code based automation

Who does it work best for?\
\

-   Startup founders, projects that are getting big.
-   Infrequently changed pages, such as test maintenance.

\

###  Testing Tools Covered

\

-   [Testium](https://testim.io/)
-   [Ghost Inspector](https://ghostinspector.com/) 
-   [Applitools Eyes](https://applitools.com/)

\
**\
Testim**: You can point and click to set up your tests, write simple
loops, and it will automate your app.\
\
The good thing is that it can also run locally on your machine. If you
are a developer, you want to make sure that you can test out your code
on your local machine.\

With Applitools:\
\

-   If a button disappears or moves, you get a record of it.
-   Wider margins suddenly appear? Got it. 
-   Duplicate buttons. Mysterious scroll bars appearing? Screens are
    captured.

\
Thank you so much, Brian, for coming to talk to our group!\

Amd as always, Happy Testing!\
