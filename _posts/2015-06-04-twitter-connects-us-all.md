Sometimes I am amazed at how easy it is to send a note to people via
Twitter. I am more amazed how often people respond!\
\
Starting in December of 2014, I decided that if I ever was going to do
it, now was the time for one last big push to attempt to finally find a
company who would take a chance on me, bring me on board, and start
getting me up to speed with automated testing with Selenium / Java. For
most of my fifteen year QA career as a manual tester, coding was never
part of the job. I had last programmed in Java in grad school \... ten
years ago. Switching from a manual testing job to an automation one was
going to be a hard sell.\

\
After finding myself unexpectedly on the wrong end of a company layoff
early December 2014, I decided I needed to devote my time to studying
Python, Java, and Selenium at least forty to fifty hours a week as I was
job searching and interviewing. It kept stinging each and every time I
would hear, after coming so close to being hired at a company, the
infamous words: \"You just aren\'t technical enough\".\
\
This blog? It\'s my wife\'s idea. She saw the copious amounts of notes I
was taking, the computer textbooks I was reviewing, and the frustration
I was feeling as I was trying to do whatever it took to get myself up to
speed. Why not capture all the knowledge I was researching and put it in
blog form? It would be a good way to organize my thoughts. Let me tell
you, it has helped me a lot! You know how people say the best way to
know if you really understand something or not, try explaining it to
someone else? I have been finding that doing just that \-- but in blog
form \-- has the same advantage! Who cares if nobody but me looks at the
blog? Because of the posts I have researched and written, I can talk
about the [Shifts in Software
Testing](http://adventuresinautomation.blogspot.com/2015/02/shifts-in-software-testing.html)
at the drop of a hat. I have been able to walk into an interview and
talk about \"[What is a QA
Engineer?](http://adventuresinautomation.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-life-of-manual-tester.html)\",
and the difference between the
[Waterfall](http://adventuresinautomation.blogspot.com/2015/01/waterfall-qa.html)
and
[Agile](http://adventuresinautomation.blogspot.com/2015/01/agile-software-development.html)
software development methodologies.\
\
I have to say,  if it wasn\'t for this blog, I don\'t think I would have
passed the screening process for Fitbit.\
\
And with Twitter,  I have been able to say \"Hello\" to my favorite
computer textbook authors, and my favorite online teachers as I have
been pushing myself to absorb information. It has been the main thing
that has kept me motivated.\
\
\... And, yes, I realize that I come across as an overexcited
hyperventilating fanboy when it comes to Selenium WebDriver and the
people who create the open-source tool! (*\"OMG! They said Hi to me!
\*\*faint\*\*\"*). If you had to spend a hectic two weeks before every
single release day performing regression testing, looking at the same
exact website using twenty different browsers and platforms, testing
every bit of functionality six ways to Sunday, including IE8, and do all
this with just your own eyeballs, a keyboard, a mouse, and an MS Excel
spreadsheet, you would become a fanboy of the technology, too!\
\
With Twitter I can drop someone a line:\
\
\... If I like someone\'s personal stories.\

\... Or if I really, really, really like a technology, especially if it
means, once the tool is set up, that I never, ever, ever have to look at
another web site in IE8 again!\
