\-\-- This weekend, I finally wrote my first Appium framework! I\'ve
been wanting to do that for a while! It uses Appium + Java + TestNG +
Hamcrest + the Page Object Pattern + Page Factories.\
\
**ApiDemos-debug.apk** is the application under test. Check out the
framework [at my GitHub
site](https://github.com/tjmaher/basic_appium_framework)!\

I am halfway finished through a code walkthrough I can place on my blog,
a series in five parts. It should be ready in a few weeks. The goal is
to give manual testers a glimpse in how an Appium framework could be
created. It\'ll have instructions on how to download and run the tests.

Happy Testing!\
