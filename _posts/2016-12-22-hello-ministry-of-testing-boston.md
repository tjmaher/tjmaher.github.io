\-\-- It looks like the [Greater Boston QA and Testing
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/), a software
testing group I spoke at a few months ago about [How to Pass a Coding
Interview as an Automation
Developer](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/11/video-10172016-how-to-pass-coding.html),
has been rebranded!\
\
Conrad Holloman \< [\@hollomancer](https://twitter.com/hollomancer) \>,
founder of the group, sent our this email yesterday:\

> *Hi, I\'m very happy to announce that the Boston QA Meetup is joining
> Ministry of Testing
> ([http://www.ministryoftesting.com](http://www.ministryoftesting.com/))
> as a sub-chapter!\
> \
> The Ministry of Testing aims to change and lead within the software
> testing world. They are doing this through a strong focus on learning,
> collaboration and resources. You are part of the story too, and we
> hope you can join us along the way!\
> As part of this change:\
> \
> We are looking at opportunities to host longer-form QA and testing
> events, and possibly something focused on the New England region!\
> \
> We will be merging our Slack chat with the global Ministry of Testing
> community!\
> \
> Additionally, we are still looking for hosts and speakers for the
> first quarter of 2017. Contact me if interested!\

I love the Ministry of Testing! I\'ve been enjoying their [testing
feeds](http://www.ministryoftesting.com/testing-feeds/) for years, and I
blog irregularly for their Software Testing Club subgroup, at
<http://www.softwaretestingclub.com/profile/TJMaher>­\
\
Hrm\... I wonder if that means that TestBash - Boston might be coming to
Massachusetts? I wonder if they need any help organizing?\

\
Happy Testing!\
