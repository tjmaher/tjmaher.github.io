\-\-- It took me seven hours, heading into Boston to catch the train to
Philadelphia, then another train to get across the city to Penn\'s
Landing to where [TestBash Philly
2017](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/2017/05/testbash-philadelphia-2017-is-live/)
is being held, but I finally made it!\
\
Today, I volunteered to help out the speakers putting on the two day
software testing conference for the [Ministry of
Testing](http://ministryoftesting.com/). Tonight I went to the
[Pre-TestBash
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-philadelphia/events/241017262/).
But before that, I was on a quest to find an authentic Philly
Cheesesteak sandwich. Luckily for me, I found [Campo\'s
Deli](http://camposdeli.com/) right off the train station and devoured
one whole.\

[]{#more}It was just a short ten minute walk to the train to the
FringeArts theater, where people were setting up for Day One of
tomorrow\'s TestBash. I made the rounds, saying hello to people, when I
bumped into Kate Paulk, who will be giving the talk, **[But I\'m Not a
Security
Tester](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/but-i-m-not-a-security-tester-security-testing-on-the-web-for-the-rest-of-us)**,
and Christine McGarry from Canada, who will be giving the talk, **[The
Fellowship of the Test: Building a Community Across Agile
Teams](https://targetingquality2017.sched.com/speaker/christine.mcgarry)**,
and Christine\'s husband.\

After hanging out a bit, we all headed to the [Pre-TestBash
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-philadelphia/events/241017262/)
at the Positano Coast, where I chatted with Ken Riley,
the [\@agile\_QA](https://twitter.com/agile_qa) evangelist and Meetup
co-organizer of the [Atlanta Quality Assurance
Association](https://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Quality-Assurance-Association-AQAA-Meetup/) and
Dave Harrison ( [\@davadora](https://twitter.com/davadora) ), Directory
of Software Testing at CardConnect.\
\
Not only were they both familiar with the correct pronunciation of the
city of Quincy, MA (QUIN-ZEE), Dave, I found out, is a regular reader of
this blog, followed me on Twitter, knew the hiring manager back when I
interviewed at Harvard University for an automation development position
a few years ago, and knew one of my favorite recruiters. (Hi, Dave! Hi,
Leo!).\
\
I also bumped into two QA recruiters for Willowtree Apps in Virginia.
Lee, a Software Test Engineer, enlightened me on the difficulty of
testing on a Roku device. She knew so much, and was able to talk about
everything in such detail, she could write a paper on it!\

As a conversation starter, to break the ice, I wore my Rick & Morty
T-Shirt. It was enough to start a conversation with Jack, one of the
inventors of [Mailinator](https://www.mailinator.com/), a TestBash
sponsor. Mailinator one of the best web application I have ever used to
mock up email addresses. He told me, briefly, about [how Mailinator came
to
be](http://paultyma.blogspot.com/2006/12/architecture-of-mailinator.html),
a fun story!\

That was a lot of fun, and what was just what I needed to make myself
comfortable dealing with the teaming crowds tomorrow.\
\
Happy Testing!\
