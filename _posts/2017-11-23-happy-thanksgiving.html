Happy Thanksgiving, Dear Reader!&nbsp;<div><br /><ul><li>May your Thanksgiving feast have included all of your requirements.</li><li>May your dinner have passed User Acceptance Testing.</li><li>After the day long Agile Sprint, may you and the people gathered 'round have a happy retrospective!</li></ul><br />One of the things I am thankful for is the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/" target="_blank">Ministry of Testing - Boston</a>, the people I have met, and the great conversations I have had while running events! This may sound odd, but before I discovered this group Summer 2016 when it crashed Fitbit, I didn't know that such a thing as local networking group of software testers existed!<br /><br /><br />I'm thankful that I volunteered to help out this group last year.<br /><br />I'm thankful that Conrad Holloman, the creator of the MoT Boston Meetup, trusted me to cover for him when he went on active duty.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm thankful that I have had the opportunity to lead this group when Conrad needed to devote more time to Operation Code.<br /><br /><br />Most of all, I am thankful for my wife, Melissa, for allowing me to excitedly bounce event ideas off her, working with me on logistics, all her help, and all of her love and support. The last Meetup I ran was <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/members/4996698/" target="_blank">Nerd Fun - Boston</a> five years ago. How much I missed it!<br /><br /><br />Oh! And if you are a veteran and need help breaking into the software development field, you must sign up for Conrad Holloman's group, <b>Operation Code</b> at&nbsp;<a href="https://operationcode.org/">https://operationcode.org/</a><br /><br /><br />From me and mine, to you and yours, I hope you have a Happy Thanksgiving!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
