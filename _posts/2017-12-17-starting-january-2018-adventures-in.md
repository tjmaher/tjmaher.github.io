\-\-- Starting January 2018, I will be trying my hand at starting a
YouTube channel, **Adventures in Automation**. **[Subscribe

**\
**This blog will still be quite active. It\'s where I post all my
research notes when I am researching a new automation tool or
technology, after all, and I am a big fan of continuous learning.\
\
In order to learn a new tool, I still will be posting sample code on my
GitHub site, and posting walkthroughs of the code on the [**Programming
Projects**](http://www.tjmaher.com/p/programming-projects.html) section
of this blog.\
\
I wanted to experiment with seeing if I could handle using a video blog
as a storytelling medium.\

you online! And Happy Testing!\
