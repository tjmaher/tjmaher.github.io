*I can\'t believe I have now been an automated developer for a whole
year!\
\
I\'ve had some experience executing before my current position executing
other people\'s automation scripts. I\'ve done lot of coursework
with [Alan Richardson\'s Selenium 2 with
WebDriver](http://compendiumdev.co.uk/page.php?title=seleniumwebdrivercourse).
There is no substitute, though, for on-the-job experience, especially at
the breakneck pace we are working at.\
\
When I started off at my job, the Sr. Automation Engineer gave myself
and another QA resource three weeks of private instruction for the next
on how Selenium WebDriver / Java was used. Within just seven months I
went from writing automated tests to writing an automated test
framework. And just last month, I started writing API tests.\
\
I owe a lot of my success in automation to this blog. I asked permission
early on to blog about the automation code I am writing. As long as I
just focus on the automation, it\'s fine. To deepen my understanding of
what I am doing, I\'ve been able to come up with little side projects,
posting my code in my portfolio at GitHub.  So far, I\'ve done:\
\

-   [Testing
    The-Internet](https://github.com/tjmaher/WebDriver_TheInternet_Advanced):
    Writing a framework vs Dave Haeffner\'s Login Page.
-   [Automate Amazon](https://github.com/tjmaher/automate-amazon):
    Writing a framework vs Amazon.com\'s shopping cart
-   [RESTful Testing Using
    Stripe](https://github.com/tjmaher/RESTful_Testing_Using_Stripe):
    Writing a framework to do API Testing vs a well-known payment
    processor. 

\
Are you an experienced automation developer? I was wondering if you
could take the time to look at a few of the projects I have been working
on and review the code? I\'m still at the stage where because I don\'t
have experience backing me up, I am just making it up as I go along. If
you have the time, I would love to get your advise!\

I am looking forward to the next twelve months. Who knows what fun
projects I will encounter? All I know is that when it comes to writing
automation, I am having the time of my life!
