\-\-- This was exactly what I was looking for! \... If only I could find
Eyal Yovel\'s demo code.\
\
We use Serenity BDD at work, an automation framework that is mainly a
web testing framework. For months [I tried to turn it into being a
mobile automation framework to test mobile
apps](http://www.tjmaher.com/p/programming-projects.html). All this
Spring, I spent trying to get working other proof-of-concepts others had
toyed with, to no avail. Mobile automation? It seemed unsupported by the
[Serenity BDD Google
Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/thucydides-users), and
still remains
[undocumented](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/thucydides-users/BNpZX87m9Ws)
in the official Serenity BDD documentation.\
\
Then I stumbled upon a European webinar announced by Sauce Labs\... that
was being held at 5:00 am Boston time. Normally, there would be a
recording published a few days later. But what if this time was
different? I couldn\'t take that chance!\

\"More and more companies deciding on mobile test automation are turning
towards Appium. While it is very popular and its adoption is growing, it
is not an easy task to implement a robust testing solution that is both
cross platform and built to scale. This webinar will explore how to
build a mobile testing strategy based on Appium and BDD.\
\
\"Join Asaf Saar, Sauce Labs Mobile Product Management Director, and
Eyal Yovel, QualiTest Senior Test Consultant, as they discuss how a
mobile testing strategy and the proper application of Page Object
patterns can help leverage Appium's power to produce concise, readable,
and maintainable automated tests for both Android and iOS.\
\
\"Here is what you will learn:\

-   \"How to define and implement a mobile testing strategy
-   \"Challenges and solutions for developing a cross-platform mobile
    testing solution
-   \"How to speed up writing tests using the Serenity BDD Framework and
    the Page Object Model

\
\"You will also see a live demo of a framework running Appium tests on
iOS and Android\"\

\
The biggest takeaway? I have been trying to decide, as I come up with a
mobile automation framework: Emulators? Or real devices-in-the-cloud?\
\
According to what they talked about, emulators for smoke tests might
actually be fine.\
