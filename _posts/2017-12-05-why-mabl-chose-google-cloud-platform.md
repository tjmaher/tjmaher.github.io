\"How do you compare and contrast technologies such as cloud service
providers? What metrics do you use as a comparison? How do you decide to
move from a technology you are familiar with to a new and different tool
which may be better for your company?\
\
\"This evening [James
Baldassari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbaldassari/), a Full Stack
Developer from Raytheon, DataXu, and now mabl \-- an early stage company
that is developing a machine-learning driven automated testing service
\-- will walk members of the Ministry of Testing - Boston through:\
\
• \"What is a cloud service provider? Why use it?\
\
• \"What features do cloud services provide?\
\
• \"What were mabl\'s business needs?\
\
\
The talk will be based on James\' blog article, [A Detailed Look at Why
mabl Chose Google Cloud Platform (GCP) over
AWS](https://www.mabl.com/why-we-chose-google-cloud-platform-over-aws-at-mabl/).
From the introduction:\
\
\"As product development was beginning at mabl in early 2017, we had to
decide which cloud provider to use. While we were most familiar with
Amazon Web Services (AWS), we decided to invest some time exploring all
of the options available to us. Based on an initial set of requirements,
we were able to narrow the list of candidates to just AWS and Google
Cloud Platform (GCP). We spent several weeks researching both and
building prototypes to familiarize ourselves with features that we had
not used before. After a thorough and objective evaluation of both
providers we decided unanimously to build on GCP\". -
