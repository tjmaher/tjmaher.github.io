So that's what STAR stands for: <i>Software Testing Analysis &amp; Review</i>. I had been wondering about that. I wonder if they are affiliated with the <a href="https://eurostarsoftwaretesting.com/" target="_blank">EuroSTAR Software Testing Conferences</a>&nbsp;coming up in October 2016?<br /><br /><h2>About STAR East:</h2><br />"STAREAST is one of the longest-running, and most respected conferences on software testing and quality assurance.

This powerful swell, fueled by a major shift toward web-based applications on desktops and mobile devices, is changing how corporations tackle software test automation. Add in a desire to replace old-guard, commercial tools in favor of newer technology with lower costs, we may have a perfect storm. However, with different technologies come new challenges...."</i>&nbsp;<a href="https://stareast.techwell.com/program/keynotes/open-source-test-automation-riding-second-wave" target="_blank">Learn More</a><br /><br /><b>Effective and Efficient Mobile Testing in an Agile Environment | Keynote by Dynatrace Industry Technical Presentation</b><br /><i>Wednesday, May 4, 2016 - 3:00 pm to 3:45 pm</i><br /><a href="https://stareast.techwell.com/program/effective-and-efficient-mobile-testing-agile-environment-keynote-dynatrace-industry">https://stareast.techwell.com/program/effective-and-efficient-mobile-testing-agile-environment-keynote-dynatrace-industry</a><br />Rachel Obstler, Eric Elkins |&nbsp;<i>Keynote by Dynatrace</i><br /><br /><i>"If it were easy to produce high-quality mobile apps, everyone would be doing it. But mobile development is tough. Consumers expect constant enhancements and a great experience on an ever-growing variety of devices. Many mobile app development teams are turning to agile to meet the time-to-market and quality demands of their customers. But these same teams often focus on changing the development (coding) process, and neglect the testing. In this session, we’ll discuss and show real examples of how to best carry out the major phases of testing within the mobile agile process, including unit..."</i>&nbsp;<a href="https://stareast.techwell.com/program/effective-and-efficient-mobile-testing-agile-environment-keynote-dynatrace-industry" target="_blank">Learn More</a><br /><br /><b>The Evolution of a Software Tester: From Novice to Practitioner</b><br /><i>Thursday, May 5, 2016 - 4:15pm to 5:15pm</i><br /><a href="https://stareast.techwell.com/program/keynotes/evolution-software-tester-novice-practitioner">https://stareast.techwell.com/program/keynotes/evolution-software-tester-novice-practitioner</a><br />Dawn Haynes |&nbsp;<i>PerfTestPlus, Inc.</i><br /><br /><i>"Once upon a time, Dawn Haynes was a software tester. Now she’s most often found in the classroom, helping others tackle the same day-to-day challenges that she has encountered on projects for the past thirty years. Dawn now recognizes that, although she had great instincts about testing that initially made her incredibly clever and effective at breaking software, it’s been the subtle questions, mantras, and foibles she’s encountered throughout her career that demonstrate how wrong some of her testing ideas have been.
