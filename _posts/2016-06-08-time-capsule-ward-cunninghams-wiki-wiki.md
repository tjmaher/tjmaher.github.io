\-\-- What year is it?\
\
The last think I remember, I came home from work early, and sat down in
front of my computer. I decided on browsing [Ward
Cunningham](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham)\'s [Wiki Wiki
Web](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiWeb)  \-- now over [twenty
years](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardsWikiTenthAnniversary) old!  \-- as I
have been doing lately, trying to get a feel what it was like in the
early days of the [Extreme
Programming](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming) movement which
became the [Agile Alliance](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AgileAlliance). Time
sped by, and the next thing I knew it was close to midnight.\

What is Wiki Wiki Web?
----------------------

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb):\

> *\"The WikiWikiWeb is the first ever wiki, or user-editable website.
> It was launched on 25 March 1995 by its inventor, programmer Ward
> Cunningham, to accompany the Portland Pattern Repository website
> discussing software design patterns. The name WikiWikiWeb originally
> also applied to the wiki software that operated the website, written
> in the Perl programming language and later renamed to \'WikiBase\'.
> The site is frequently referred to by its users as simply \'Wiki\',
> and a convention established among users of the early network of wiki
> sites that followed was that using the word with a capitalized W
> referred exclusively to the original site\".\
> \
> \"\[\...\] The software and website were developed in 1994 by
> Cunningham in order to make the exchange of ideas between programmers
> easier. The concept was based on the ideas developed in HyperCard
> stacks that Cunningham built in the late 1980s. On March 25, 1995, he
> installed the software on his company\'s (Cunningham & Cunningham)
> website, c2.com. Cunningham came up with the name WikiWikiWeb because
> he remembered a Honolulu International Airport counter employee who
> told him to take the Wiki Wiki Shuttle, a shuttle bus line that runs
> between the airport\'s terminals. \'Wiki Wiki\' is a reduplication of
> \'wiki\', a Hawaiian language word for Quick. Cunningham\'s idea was
> to make WikiWikiWeb\'s pages quickly editable by its users, so he
> initially thought about calling it \"QuickWeb\", but later changed his
> mind and dubbed it \'WikiWikiWeb\'.*

Since I have been trying to somehow turn into a [Real
Programmer](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RealProgrammer), I have spent a lot
of time trying to learn how to incorporate [Unit
tests](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnitTest) and [Software Design
Patterns](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatterns) into my automation
development.\
\
I stumbled on this site last year when I was trying to search for tips
on [Object Oriented](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ObjectOriented) programming.
 and found out there were [many
definitions](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DefinitionsForOo) for what that
means.\
\
Watch out! You can spend hours trying to [Find a
Page](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage) and end up sucked in just like
me.\
\
Here are a few fun entries I found:\
\

Writing Code
------------

\
There is a huge section on [Extreme
Programming](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming) and [Test Driven
Development](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment) by [Kent
Beck](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?KentBeck) that I would list as required
reading for any manual QA person attempting to get into software
development.\
\
Make sure to read all about the [Agile
Manifesto](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AgileManifesto).\
\
After that is done, you can read about [Software Design
Patterns](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatterns) ( and the [Gang of
Four](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GangOfFour) ) which help and
[AntiPatterns](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AntiPattern) which hinder.\
\
Around my workplace, the developers still talk about [Design By
Contract](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignByContract).\
\
It also has entries on the two text editors still favored:\

-   [Emacs](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EmacsEditor)
-   [Vi](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ViEditor)
-   [Emacs vs Vi](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EmacsVsVi): And old time funny
    flame war!

\
It has pages on the two main Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
used now:\

-   [Eclipse IDE](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EclipseIde) 
-   [IntelliJ IDEA 2.0](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?IntellijIdea) 

\

Writing Tests 
--------------

\
When it talked about [Testing
Frameworks](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestingFramework) I expected the
section for [JUnit](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnit) written by [Kent
Beck](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?KentBeck) and [Erich
Gamma](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ErichGamma). It also has a section on
[TestNG](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestEnGee), added six years ago,
probably by it\'s creator [Cedric
Beust](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CedricBeust).\
\
They also cover various typed of [Automated
tests](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AutomatedTest) such as:\

-   [Unit tests](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnitTest)
-   [Acceptance Tests](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AcceptanceTest)
-   [Regression Tests](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RegressionTesting)

\

Building Software
-----------------

\
What intrigued me is showcased **build tools** such as:\

-   [Apache Ant](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ApacheAnt) 
-   [Ant vs Make](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AntVsMake) 
-   [Apache Maven](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ApacheMaven) 

\
\... Nothing yet on Gradle, though, a build tool we are starting to use
more extensively at work.\
\
Wiki Wiki Web. It\'s a nice little time capsule.\
\
Happy Testing!\
