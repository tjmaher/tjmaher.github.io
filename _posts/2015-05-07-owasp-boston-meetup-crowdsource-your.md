At my previous position, I performed a bit of entry-level security
testing, so I was familiar with the Open Web Application Security
Project Group ([OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/)) name, with their website
and the [Testing
Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents)
that they update every few years. What I didn\'t know was that OWASP had
formed a [Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/owaspboston/) last year
that has met every few months at Akamai Technologies starting in March
of 2014.\
\
OWASP - Boston is planning on holding regular meetings on the first
Wednesday of every month.\

### Past OWASP Meetups

Past meetups of the OWASP Group \-- according to their Meetup site \--
have been:\

-   Training sessions on SQL injection
    ([SQLi](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_SQL_Injection_(OTG-INPVAL-005)))
    and using [WebGoat](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Webgoat)  to
    understand vulnerabilities in J2EE and ASP.Net applications.  (
    [Meetup link](http://www.meetup.com/owaspboston/events/165671802/)
     )
-   Training sessions on exploring the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy
    ([ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ZAP) ) ( [Meetup
    link](http://www.meetup.com/owaspboston/events/185676452/)  ) 
-   Using [xssValidator](https://github.com/nVisium/xssValidator)  \--
    an extension of [Burp
    Proxy](http://portswigger.net/burp/proxy.html) \-- to automate
    testing for Cross Site Scripting
    ([XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS) ) errors. ( [Meetup
    link](http://www.meetup.com/owaspboston/events/192146532/) )

### Announcements from Jim Weilier

While noshing on pizza that Akamai had ordered for us attendees, the
founder of the OWASP - Boston Meetup group and chapter leader of OWASP
Boston, Jim Weiler, gave a few updates:\

-   **T-Shirts for Sale**: Apollo Clark \-- founder of the [Boston Kali
    Linux Users Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Kali-Linux-Users)
     that I had [written about in my
    blog](http://adventuresinautomation.blogspot.com/2015/04/security-testing-with-kali-linux-intro.html)
     \-- had designed T-Shirts for the group and donated the design to
    OWASP. OWASP is selling them for \$10.00. Out of every purchase,
    \$1.50 is donated to OWASP, a non-profit organization.

\
\

-   **New Meetup Locations**: Along with meeting at Akamai for Cambridge
    / Boston area people, Constant Contact in Waltham has offered to
    sponsor Meetups so people near Route 128 can get involved with
    OWASP. 

<!-- -->

-   **Outreach programs**: OWASP is reaching out to the community, with
    groups as various as software quality folks, ISO (International
    Organization for Standardization) groups and college students so
    that security standards can be introduced before they are ever
    needed. Jim is also looking for speakers. Have a five or ten minute
    talk? Volunteer to become a speaker at an OWASP meeting. Whether it
    is an informal talk or Powerpoint slide, the important thing is, as
    Jim said, \"Any transmission of knowledge is useful\". 

### Announcements from Roy Watterson

Roy Watterson, the co-founder of the OWASP Boston Meetup, stood up and
spoke briefly about how to keep in touch with what OWASP Boston is
doing:\
\

-   OWASP Boston Chapter: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston
-   Twitter: [\@OWASPBOSTON](https://twitter.com/OWASPBOSTON) 
-   OWASP Boston Meetup: http://www.meetup.com/owaspboston/

\
Roy went around the room, asking if there were any other announcements:\
\

-   **New Security Meetup**: Apollo Clark mentioned about how he started
    a new Meetup, the  [Boston Kali Linux Users
    Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Kali-Linux-Users) 
-   **New Jobs Available**: Many companies are hiring, looking for
    security testers. Even one of the companies speaking at the Meetup,
    [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/careers), is looking for people. 
-   **Recent Talks**: Roy mentioned the OWASP [Top Ten Internet of
    Things](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Top_Ten_Project)
    gave a talk recently ( [slide
    deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B52IUvO0LP6OdW1HMjRpM3VVUVE/view)
     ) and if anyone is interested in security of devices such as
    Fitbit, they should review the presentation. 
-   **Security BSides Boston
    2015** [http://www.bsidesboston.org](http://www.bsidesboston.org/)
    is this Saturday. Unfortunately, Roy said, all tickets are now sold
    out\... Although you can request to be placed on the waiting list. 
-   **SOURCE Security Conference and Training**: [This
    conference](http://www.sourceconference.com/boston/) will be held on
    May 25-28 at the Marriott Courtyard - Boston. If you put in
    OWASP2572, it will be \$100 off the price of admission.
-   And yes, [Akamai is
    hiring](http://www.akamai.com/html/careers/index.html)!

### Buying Into the Bias: Why Vulnerability Statistics Suck

\
For the next section, Jim Weiler sketched out a lecture he once attended
at Black Hat Briefings, presented by Steve Christey, from MITRE, and
Brian Martin, from the Open Security Foundation.\
\
The lecture was given at Black Hat on July 31, 2013. Below is what I
found on YouTube.\

From
[siliconANGLE\'s](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/07/24/vulnerability-statistics-suck/)
 write-up of this past event:\
\

>  \"Christey and Martin will explore the limitations improperly
> gathered and analyzed statistics and how they could ultimately be
> deleterious to an organizations bottom line.\
> Martin has, for the previous 15 years, worked in the field of
> collecting, studying and cataloging vulnerabilities. He is currently
> the Content Manager for the Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB)
> and has actively advocated for the evolution of VDBs for many years.
> His work in the vulnerability disclosure process has included seeking
> new vulnerabilities, writing advisories, coordinating disclosure and
> working with several organizations, helping them to improve their
> vulnerability handling and response. Martin is also a member of the
> Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Editorial Board. 

> \"Co-hosting the presentation with Martin, Christey is a Principal
> Information Security Engineer in the Security and Information
> Operations Division of The MITRE Corporation. Christey also serves as
> the editor of the CVE list as well as being the Chair of the CVE
> Editorial Board. He has been a contributor to vulnerability studies
> and was co-author of the influential "Responsible Vulnerability
> Disclosure Process" IETF draft of 2002. His focus of late has revolved
> around secure software development and testing, consumer-friendly
> software security metrics, the theoretical underpinnings of
> vulnerabilities, and vulnerability research\". - [Alan

### Crowdsource Your Security Testing with Bugcrowd

::: {style="text-align: left;"}
For the next section, Leif Dreizler from Bugcrowd talked about Bugcrowd,
and its success in crowdsourcing security testing. He spoke about using
\"bug bounties\", highlighting its use at Google, Mozilla, and
Microsoft.
