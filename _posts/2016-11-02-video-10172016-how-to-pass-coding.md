\-\-- I was invited to give a talk to the Greater Boston QA and Testing
Meetup, based on my recently published TechBeacon article, [**How to
Pass a Coding Interview as an Automation
Developer**](http://techbeacon.com/how-pass-coding-interview-automation-developer).
I\'ve given internal talks about QA and informal training sessions to
small groups of fellow co-workers before, but this was was my first
public talk in my twenty year software testing career! Thank you Conrad
Holloman!\

The slides are slightly fuzzy in the presentation. I altered them
slightly and placed them on my account
on **[SlideShare.net/tjmaher1](http://www.slideshare.net/tjmaher1) **so
you could get a better look at them.\
