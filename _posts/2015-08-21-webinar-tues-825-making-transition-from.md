> *\"If you have been manually testing your Web application, making the
> transition to test automation can seem daunting. Where do you start,
> how do you determine what tests to automate and what tools do you use?
> These are questions that are at the top of the list for every first
> timer. Smoothing your transition to building test automation can be
> made easier with a little preparation and the right tools.* 

> *\"In this webinar we will discuss the key differences between manual
> and automated testing and provide tips to help you prepare for the
> transition. We will also show you how QA analysts that are not
> programmers can build test automation quickly and very easily using
> the eureQa Testing Platform, and run these tests across browsers and
> devices on the Sauce Labs' Cloud.* 

> *\"This webinar will cover:*\
>
> -   *\"Preparing to automate cross browser/cross device tests -- what
>     to expect and what to look out for?*
>
> <!-- -->

>
> <!-- -->
