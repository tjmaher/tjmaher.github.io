"Are you a manual tester? Are you attempting to switch careers in the software industry? Are you trying to break into automation development? In this article, I will outline how I made the transition from being a manual quality assurance engineer—a technical position that deals with next to no actual coding—to an automated testing position, where I am programming in Selenium and Java daily.<br /><br />"This transition didn't come overnight. It took years to lay the groundwork for this career shift. Because I found the transition difficult, I'd like to share some pointers with other software testers who are in a similar situation in order to make their career shift easier than mine was".<br /><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br />... I've always enjoyed writing, from classes in high school and college, to technical writing at the workplace, but I have only been writing regularly for the past year-and-a-half with this blog. What started out as a form of interview prep became a public space where I could grapple with new concepts I am learning on-the-job, and bounce off ideas with others attempting to hone their automation development skills.<br /><br />I decided in February that I wanted to branch out. I saw that&nbsp;<a href="http://techbeacon.com/switching-careers-qa-manual-testing-automation-development" target="_blank">TechBeacon</a>, an online magazine by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, were searching for contributors. I wondered if I could transform any of my <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/p/table-of-contents.html" target="_blank">eighty-plus</a> stream-of-consciousness rambles into an actual article?<br /><br /><i>"I have been part of the software testing industry since the dot-coms first started roaming the earth, and for most of my career, it has been pretty much the same. My job as a software tester has always been to act as an end-user advocate. I provide a voice for customers of the web application that I am testing. After distilling both the product requirements and the user interface design into test cases, I execute them as a manual tester, using the same tools our customers will use: a keyboard, a mouse, or fingers on a touchscreen".&nbsp;</i><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T9UNkA14ZEU/Vwco6CFoH0I/AAAAAAAAK9c/IRBFul-NNfwULlqHOPCprE2CUkTp0sFFw/s1600/TechBeacon.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="278" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T9UNkA14ZEU/Vwco6CFoH0I/AAAAAAAAK9c/IRBFul-NNfwULlqHOPCprE2CUkTp0sFFw/s400/TechBeacon.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My First Published Article, on <a href="http://techbeacon.com/switching-careers-qa-manual-testing-automation-development" target="_blank">TechBeacon</a>!</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Two days after expressing interest in writing an article and submitting to TechBeacon my blog as a writing sample, the editor&nbsp;<a href="http://techbeacon.com/contributors/robert-mitchell" target="_blank">Robert Mitchell</a>&nbsp;sent me an email to see if we could chat about a blog post of mine that might be a good fit for the magazine. We decided on the April 2015 entry, "<a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/04/how-to-switch-careers-in-software.html" target="_blank">How to Switch Careers in the Software Industry</a>". Robert drafted an outline based on the blog post that he could present to the review board for approval.<br /><br /><i>"[...]&nbsp;<b>The relationship between development and QA shouldn't be the same as the relationship between an artist and an art critic. It should be more like the relationship between a writer and a copy editor, both applying their specialized skill sets to make a quality product</b>".</i><br /><br />Within two weeks of being approved, the article was content-edited to smooth the structure, and copy-edited to fix a typo or two I had missed. I can spot a typo from a mile away, but am completely blind to mine own.<br /><br /><i><b>"Coders learn to code by going beyond the classroom, experimenting on their own with writing programs and apps. Automated testers do the same with random sites on the web: How would I test this web page, and what tests would I write?"</b></i><br /><i><br /></i>... So, that is the story how I got paid for my very first article!<br /><br />If you care to read the whole thing, it is <a href="http://techbeacon.com/switching-careers-qa-manual-testing-automation-development" target="_blank">here</a>. I am quite happy how it turned out! :) ... And around five cents a word, too. Not bad! :)<br /><br />-T.J.
