\-\-- [I am loving working at Fitbit - Boston! I have only been here a
bit under two months, but I am already making great friends at work. I
am learning not just to write Selenium / Java code, but how to be a
software developer. ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

[I noticed on the  [Sauce Labs
Blog](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2015/04/video-jason-huggins-fixing-healthcare-gov-one-test-at-a-time/) that
Jason Huggins, creator of Selenium 1.0 and founder / CTO of Sauce Labs
was gave a talk on his involvement on testing the HealthCare.gov
website. I commandeered a conference room here at Fitbit - Boston and
did a screening of the Meetup talk on
YouTube. ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

Jason Huggins presented a wonderful personal account bout his experience
in being part of the \"tech surge\" team responsible for analyzing and
fixing the HealthCare.gov site. He speaks candidly, talking about his
anxiety, his confusion, using his public messages on Twitter and private
text messages to illustrate the story. It presents a good slice of life
of what it was like in the war room of this
project. ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
It presents more of a personal than a technical experience. Even if you
are not technical, the talk is very entertaining. Jason is quite a good
storyteller. ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[The first hour details Jason\'s personal narrative. The next fifteen
minutes deals with \"Lessons Learned\", and the last fifteen minutes is
a call to action to get bright minds to work with and get involved with
government projects, for the good of the
country. ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
If you want to get involved, Jason was mentioning that you can go the
White House Playbook to <https://github.com/WhiteHouse/playbook>, review
what they have at <https://playbook.cio.gov/> and you can \"do a pull\"
on their GitHub section to make a
change. ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
One minor quibble\... Jason mentioned that he thinks automated testing
should only be done by Java developers, and not with those non-technical
manual testers. After this project? He found out that they do have their
uses\... As someone who has spent fifteen years as a manual tester, I
have to say that I am very glad for that! I just wish that there was
more a push to convert manual testers to automation instead of having
every manual tester fending for him or herself trying to make the
transition. It would have made my life a lot easier!
