With all that's been going on lately, I missed a very important anniversary...<br /><br />As of last month, I have spent twenty years in the software testing industry.<br /><br /><h2>How I Started: From a Computer Science Major to a QA Engineer</h2><br />Unsure how I wanted to apply my Computer Science degree, I left college for a bit during my Junior year at Bridgewater State. Businesses were just starting to invade the web, causing the early pioneers of this new electronic frontier to grumble.<br /><br />Demand was so high to find people to staff these new "dot.coms", placement agencies were called in to weed through job applications and find good candidates. I found myself at one of these agencies, Sally Silver Contract Services. After testing my analytical skills and reviewing my technical background, some code samples of work I was doing in the classroom, and a rough portfolio from when I spent two years in a college job as a graphic artist / desktop publisher, they asked me, "Have you ever heard of 'Quality Assurance'? Oracle has a new division in Massachusetts, a three month contract position with an option for extension..."<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><h2>Back to School: Finishing BSCS, and Earning Masters of Software Engineering</h2><br />That was my first assignment as a QA contract consultant, back in August 1996. I finished up my BSCS/ Theatre Minor in 1999. My Masters of Software Engineering from Brandeis in 2008 helped me understand the entire software development life cycle, where for one semester I could be a database developer, and for another, a project manager.<br /><br />This technical skillset has served me well, even before I became an automation developer, allowing me to develop good working relationships with developers, project managers, and user experience designers, and its helped me hit-the-ground-running with projects.<br /><br /><h2>Why I'm Passionate About QA</h2><br />I've always loved QA! Networking with:<br /><br /><ul><li>Project managers to test the requirements</li><li>Developers to test the product</li><li>User experience people to see how we can make the product more intuitive</li><li>Marketers to make sure we are building a product that meets the customer's needs</li></ul><div>... My most important role as a QA Engineer is to be an end-user advocate.</div><br /><h2>Changes in Software Testing</h2><br /><div>Right now we're seeing some interesting changes in software testing:<br /><br /><ul><li>Developers and System Administration and QA are being smooshed into "DevOps".&nbsp;</li><li>Traditional QA manual testing roles are being rewritten, with the one-two punch of open-source automated testing tools and continuous integration, where QA teams are being ramped up to learn how to code.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><br /><h2>Adapting To Change</h2><br />I am also seeing interesting changes in my role in QA. I now seem to be a published writer, working on my third Automation Development article for <a href="http://techbeacon.com/">TechBeacon.com</a> which should be published in a few weeks. <br /><br />I've switched from being a manual to an automated tester. Maybe in a few years I can become a Software Developer in Test, or maybe a QA Manager. I miss when I was acting as a QA Lead for an offshore team of five manual mobile testers. That was fun! ... Whatever the future brings, I am looking forward to it.&nbsp;</div><br />Here's to the next Twenty Years in Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
