Meetup.com is a wonderful resource! I met most of my friends through
Nerd Fun Boston, where I was an event coordinator for a good three
years, running five events a week back in 2008 - 2010, gathering groups
of geeks to bounce around Boston, going to lectures historical,
technological, and scientific all around Harvard University, Harvard
Medical, the Museum of Science, and MIT.\
\
When I became an automation developer a year-and-a-half ago, I sought
out many different [software development Meetup
groups](http://www.tjmaher.com/search/label/Meetup), some security
testing Meetups, but no QA Meetups.\
\
Fitbit-Boston has been hosting a lot of Meetups at its new space ever it
moved into its large office last August\... the
[ReactJS](http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Boston/) Meetup meets there
regularly. Today, this new group, [The Boston QA
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-QA-Meetup) which formed last
October, [met
there](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-QA-Meetup/events/231893839/).\
\
It was fun! James Moore, the man who founded the Boston automation
department two-and-a-half years ago gave a fun and entertaining talk
about how we handle automated testing at work. And the main organizer of
The Boston QA Meetup, Conrad Hollomon, QA Engineer also presented.\
\
Conrad\'s talk, \"A Brief History of Software Quality, Pt. 1\", was
amazing! In this first part the focus was on Quality, and how is was
measured, touching on Egyptians building the pyramids, quality in the
Hammurabi Code, and mostly focused on how design principles, and a focus
on quality saved the Japanese automobile industry.\
\
Can\'t wait until Part II!\
\
Until then, Happy Testing!\
