\-\-- Good day! I was wondering if I could bother you for a bit. I was
working on two projects, one for creating an automated testing framework
for an eCommerce site, and one for testing a REST API endpoint:\

-   <https://github.com/tjmaher/automate-amazon>

\
\
\... I coded them as I would at my workplace.\
\
I\'d like to recruit other automated developers in the software industry
to possibly take a look at it and give me their feedback.\
\
Let\'s compare and contrast what we do in their own workplace.\
\
Maybe we could compare notes?\
\
Thank you very much for your time!\
