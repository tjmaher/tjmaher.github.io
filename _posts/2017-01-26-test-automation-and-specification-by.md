\-\-- That. Was. Wonderful! The [Ministry of Testing -
Boston](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/) (formerly
the Greater Boston QA and Testing Group) kicked off the first Meetup of
2017. I acted as co-host for the first time, meeting-and-greeting people
for the first time since I was made co-organizer of the group!\
\
I haven\'t run a Meetup since I was last hyperactive with the [Nerd Fun
- Boston Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston) over five years
ago. Back then, I lead a herd of nerds to crash other people\'s events:
lectures historical, technological, and scientific all over Boston and
Cambridge. Now, I was the person setting up for the event! Luckily,
Conrad, the owner of the Meetup group, found a speaker and the location;
all I needed to do was set up and meet-and-greet.\
\
That reminds me: I need to find speakers and places to host upcoming
Meetups for Ministry of Testing - Boston or it is going to be merely
Dinner and QA Discussion events (In the style of \"[Lean
Coffees](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/236646569/)\")
on the official event calendar as far as the eye can see. Are you a QA
Manager in the Cambridge / Boston area who loves talking about your own
personal testing philosophy? Come up with a topic you want to share, and
talk to
[Conrad](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/members/194532776/)
about hosting one of our Meetups. Who knows? Maybe in the audience of
your talk will be your next new hire!\

[**Subject:**]{.underline} Test Automation In The Hands Of "The
Business": How Specification By Example Is Changing How We Plan and Test
Our Solutions

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

**[Date]{.underline}**: Wednesday, January 25, 2016 @ 6:00 pm

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

**Location**:  [Izotope](https://www.izotope.com/), Cambridge, MA\
\
**[Description:]{.underline}** \"We're seeing an increase in the
adoption of Specification By Example (SBE) in the forms of Acceptance
Test Driven Development (ATDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD):
Tools and techniques designed to complement and accelerate these
adoptions especially at the enterprise solution level (where even a
small reduction in solution delivery time can have a very significant
return on investment.) Quality Assurance (QA) professionals are uniquely
prepared to lead the adoption (and prove the effectiveness) of these
solution verification and validation methods due to QA's need and desire
to understand detailed and general solution behavior, architecture,
usability and more. This talk will include a review of these methods
including their origin, several use cases, and tools, techniques and
resources for personal investigation\".\
\

About the Talk
--------------

Greg Tutunjian has been an Application Developer, a Systems Engineer, a
Team Builder and Agile Delivery Lead, and currently is an Enterprise
Agile Coach. As he puts it, \"Experience Informs\". He took us through
snapshots of his entire career, from testing, validating, and leading
his teams.

As Greg put it in the summary of his talk, \"Quality Assurance (QA)
professionals are uniquely prepared to lead the adoption (and prove the
effectiveness) of these solution verification and validation methods\".\
\
**Why QA Professionals?** QA are already better equipped. They already
do:\

-   Outside-In Testing. White box, black box testing. 
-   Solution centric vs development centric 
-   Incrememnting Value 
-   More Multidisciplicinary 
-   Direction Setting, examining metrics. 
-   Forming a Community of Practice: Centers of Excellence: Defines the
    standards and expectations

### *Sidenote: What is a Community of Practice? *

According to
[Wenger-Trayner](http://wenger-trayner.com/resources/what-is-a-community-of-practice/),
a \"community of practice is a group of people who share a concern or a
passion for something they do, and learn how to do it better as they
interact regularly.\
\
\"This definition reflects the fundamentally social nature of human
learning. It is very broad. It applies to a street gang, whose members
learn how to survive in a hostile world, as well as a group of engineers
who learn how to design better devices or a group of civil servants who
seek to improve service to citizens\".\

### Where Does Greg Come Into Play As An Agile Coach?

</div>

<div>

To answer the question when Greg comes into play as an Agile Coach, he
mentioned the Satir Change Model. \"Virginia Satir, a pioneer of family
therapy, developed a model of how individuals experience change. The
Satir Change Model says that as we cope with unexpected or significant
change, we predictably move through four stages: Late Status Quo, Chaos,
Practice and Integration, and New Status Quo\".

                                                                                                                  *From <https://stevenmsmith.com/ar-satir-change-model/>*

Greg comes aboard just after the Chaos, working with the team to come up
with Practice and Integration.\

### How Business Validation Has Been Performed

Greg walked us through the many different models of business validation
he has come across since the 1970s:\

-   Back in **1975**: It started with technical specifications, or
    specs.
-   **1985**: Business requirement documents: BRD. ( See \"[BRD, a High
    Level
    Review\"](https://www.isixsigma.com/implementation/project-selection-tracking/business-requirements-document-high-level-review/))
-   **1990s**: Rapid prototyping
-   **2000**: Model behavior and predictive knowledge
-   **2005**: Agile, and the small team movement

What Greg likes to use is a Specification by Example: (SBE): A
collaboration method for specifying requirements and tests, Acceptance
Test Driven Development (ATDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

### Sidenote: What is Specification by Example?

<div>

From **Martin Fowler\'s** blog
[SpecificationByExample](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SpecificationByExample.html)
dated March 2004, 

</div>

> *\"I was attending a workshop at XP/Agile Universe in 2002 when the
> phrase \'Specification By Example\' struck me as a way to describe one
> of roles of testing in
> [XP](https://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html#xp) \[\...\]\
> \"Specification By Example isn\'t the way most of us have been brought
> up to think of specifications. Specifications are supposed to be
> general, to cover all cases. Examples only highlight a few points, you
> have to infer the generalizations yourself. This does mean that
> Specification By Example can\'t be the only requirements technique you
> use, but it doesn\'t mean that it can\'t take a leading role.\
> \"\[\...\] One of the great things about specification by example is
> that examples are usually much easier to come up with, particularly
> for the non-nerds who we write the software for\".*

### Sidenote: What is Acceptance Test Driven Development?

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

From **Elisabeth Hendrickson\'s** blog, [Test
Obsessed](http://testobsessed.com/2008/12/acceptance-test-driven-development-atdd-an-overview/)
dated December 2008, 

</div>

> *\"Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) is a practice in which
> the whole team collaboratively discusses acceptance criteria, with
> examples, and then distills them into a set of concrete acceptance
> tests before development begins. It's the best way I know to ensure
> that we all have the same shared understanding of what it is we're
> actually building. It's also the best way I know to ensure we have a
> shared definition of Done.\
> \"Obviously I think this is an important Agile development practice.
> In fact, it's one of the core pieces of my Agile Testing class. Yet
> somehow I have neglected to write about it much on this blog. Time to
> rectify that.\
> \"So, for your reading pleasure, I now present a [PDF document with a
> detailed example of the whole ATDD
> flow](http://testobsessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/atddexample.pdf)\".*

### Where Should You Start?

<div>

Greg advises, don\'t start out with a small unimportant area to start
automating ... start with a high-risk solution area, a bigger piece of
work when you are pitching Agile. It is better for a manager to sell it.
Work in Pairs. Facilitate Workshops. 

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

Greg could not stress the importance of putting together a Community of
Practice: 

</div>

> [***\"A lot of great success happens in
> silence". ***]{style="font-size: large;"}

<div>

Put your success on a blog. Write about it. Talk about it. Share it. 

</div>

### How does an Agile Project get started?

Greg says the first step is how he tries to find a good business partner
and project. Then:\

-   He adopts basic business scenarios.
-   He writes the step definitions.
-   Establishes a technology - facing flow.
-   Coaches, mentors, and Trains the Business.
-   Scale to Maximize the ROI

Thank you very much, Greg for speaking at the Ministry of Testing -
Meetup!\
\
Happy Testing!\
