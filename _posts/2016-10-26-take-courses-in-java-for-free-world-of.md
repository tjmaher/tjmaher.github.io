\-\-- Are you a manual tester trying to learn the Java Programming
language, but you just can\'t get it?\
\
Have you tried picking up the programming language from books such as:\
\

-   The comical [Head First
    Java](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208/) by
    Kathy Sierra
-   The book specifically geared towards automated testers, [Java for
    Testers](http://javafortesters.com/) by Alan Richardson

\
You can also take a look at the free [Java
Tutorials](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html) that
Oracle provides:\
\
\"The Java Tutorials are practical guides for programmers who want to
use the Java programming language to create applications. They include
hundreds of complete, working examples, and dozens of lessons. Groups of
related lessons are organized into \'[Learning
trails](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html)\'\"\

-   [Getting
    Started](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/index.html)---\"An
    introduction to Java technology and lessons on installing Java
    development software and using it to create a simple program.\"
-   [Learning the Java
    Language](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html)---\"Lessons
    describing the essential concepts and features of the Java
    Programming Language.\"
-   [Essential Java
    Classes](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/index.html)---\"Lessons
    on exceptions, basic input/output, concurrency, regular expressions,
    and the platform environment.\"

Need a bit more hand-holding? Have you ever heard of
[MOOC.org](http://mooc.org/)?\
\
According to
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course),
\"The term MOOC \[**Massive Open Online Course**\] was coined in 2008 by
Dave Cormier of the University of Prince Edward Island in response to a
course called Connectivism and Connective Knowledge (also known as
CCK08). CCK08, which was led by George Siemens of Athabasca University
and Stephen Downes of the National Research Council, consisted of 25
tuition-paying students in Extended Education at the University of
Manitoba, as well as over 2200 online students from the general public
who paid nothing \[\...\]\
\
\"Other cMOOCs were then developed; for example, Jim Groom from The
University of Mary Washington and Michael Branson Smith of York College,
City University of New York hosted MOOCs through several universities
starting with 2011\'s \'Digital Storytelling\' (ds106) MOOC. These early
MOOCs did not rely on posted resources, learning management systems and
video lectures, instead using structures that mix the learning
management system with more open web resources.\[MOOCs from private,
non-profit institutions emphasized prominent faculty members and
expanded existing distance learning offerings (e.g., podcasts) into free
and open online courses\".\
\
\"Alongside the development of these open courses, other E-learning
platforms emerged - such as [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), Peer-to-Peer University
([P2PU](https://www.p2pu.org/)), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and
ALISON - which are viewed as similar to MOOCs and work outside the
university system or emphasize individual self-paced lessons\".\
\
I just received this email from edX, Harvard and MIT\'s Mooc. There are
now three new Java Courses available:\

-   [**Introduction to Programming with Java -** Part 1: Starting to
    Code with
    Java](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-programming-java-part-1-uc3mx-it-1-1x-1):
    Released again on **October 4, 2016**. Available until June 2017.
-   [**Introduction to Programming with Java** - Part 2: Writing Good
    Code](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-programming-java-part-2-uc3mx-it-1-2x-0):
    Available on **November 1, 2016**, until June 2017.
-   [**Introduction to Programming with Java** - Part 3: Fundamental
    Data Structures and
    Algorithms](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-programming-java-part-3-uc3mx-it-1-3x):
    Starts **April 27, 2017**.

\
Don\'t want to wait? There are on edX a lot of [Self Paced Introductory
courses on
Java](https://www.edx.org/course/?search_query=java&availability=Self-Paced&level=Introductory) already!\
\
Happy Testing!\
