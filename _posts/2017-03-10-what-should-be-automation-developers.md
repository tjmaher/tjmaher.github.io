\-\-- I have a question for all the automation developers in the
audience:\
\
Let\'s say you have a manual tester who wishes to become an automation
developer. What is the first language you would advise that the manual
tester learn?  Java? JavaScript? Python? Ruby? Or does it not really
matter?\
\
When someone asks me, I usually say: Java or JavaScript. It feel like
those are the most in demand here in the Boston job market when it comes
to automation.\
\
Why do I say Java? Because, well, I am probably biased. It\'s my
favorite language. It\'s the one I studied in grad school. It\'s the one
in which I have two years of work experience. And it is the one I feel
is in the most in demand. Studying it gives you good, solid Object
Oriented Programming. It may have the hardest learning curve, but I
think it is worth it. Work through Alan Richardson\'s Java for Testers.
Purchase Alan\'s course, Selenium WebDriver with Java. Start reading
classic software design books such as Robert C. Martin\'s [Agile
Development: Principles, Patterns, and
Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445),
and his [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile
Craftmanship](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).
Or Martin Fowler\'s
[Refactoring](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672):
Improving the Design of Existing Code. You will become well-versed not
just in automation, but in software development.\
\
Why do I say JavaScript? So many web-based front ends are being
developed in JavaScript such as AngularJS and ViewJS, and web apps that
are in Node.JS. Automation developers are pairing these web apps with
frameworks that are also in JavaScript. See my blog post [Learning
JavaScript](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/10/learning-javascript.html) to
see links I have collected.\
\
I attempted to make the case on Tuesday to the other Ministry of Testing
- Boston members that Java was good because it was more difficult than
Python and Ruby\... and it wasn\'t until I expressed it with the other
members that I realized how daft I sounded.\
\
They saw my point\... but the problem was that I didn\'t realize was
that if someone wants to start learning coding on their own, it might be
best to pick languages such as Python or Ruby which might not have such
a steep learning curve.\
\
So, what do you think? :) Please vote, below!\
