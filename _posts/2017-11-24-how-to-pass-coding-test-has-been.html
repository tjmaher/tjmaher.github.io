It took more than a few sleepless nights, but my pre-recorded video, "<b>How To Pass A Coding Interview As An Automation Developer</b>", was finally worthy of being submitted to the <a href="http://automationguild.com/" target="_blank">AutomationGuild.com</a>!<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Join 20+ test automation experts like <a href="https://twitter.com/tjmaher1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tjmaher1</a> &amp; discover how to succeed with automation <a href="https://t.co/TAXca4kA9e">https://t.co/TAXca4kA9e</a> <a href="https://t.co/dxqZ179UQM">pic.twitter.com/dxqZ179UQM</a></div>â€” Joe Colantonio (@jcolantonio) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcolantonio/status/932622887000924165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> <br />Summer 2016 was tough for me. It was the first time I realized that Whiteboard Coding Tests -- getting up in front of a whiteboard and solving various coding problems as found on <a href="http://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">LeetCode.com</a>&nbsp;-- was the norm when going on automation developer interviews.<br /><br />This may sound odd, but I couldn't understand, at first, why interviewers were asking me to code in real time in front of them. What did automation development have to do with software development? ... It took me a while to realize that <i>automation development</i> was <i>software development</i>.<br /><br />Based on my experience, I <a href="https://techbeacon.com/how-pass-coding-interview-automation-developer" target="_blank">wrote an article on TechBeacon</a> back in September 2016 that I then turned into a presentation and <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/11/video-10172016-how-to-pass-coding.html" target="_blank">gave to the Ministry of Testing - Boston Meetup</a> a month later.<br /><br />This year, I decided that, even though I was new at this and it scared the heck of me, I really wanted to try my hand at public speaking. I submitted proposals to <a href="http://stpcon.com/" target="_blank">STPCon.com</a>&nbsp;and the Ministry of Testing without any luck. I was then contacted by Joe Colantonio from <a href="http://testtalks.com/" target="_blank">TestTalks.com</a> to see if I wanted submit a pre-recorded video to his online conference, the <a href="http://automationguild.com/" target="_blank">AutomationGuild.com</a>, and be a guest speaker.<br /><br />It took me a few nights, but it is finally done!<br /><br />As stressful as it was in the beginning... by the time it was done, I was having a lot of fun with it.<br /><br />... I wonder if I could turn Adventures in Automation into a video blog?<br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
