\-\-- On Tuesday, February 6th, 2018, the [Ministry of Testing -
Boston](http://bit.ly/mot_boston) was invited by
[Mabl](http://mabl.com/) to hear John Kinnebrew and Sergei Makar-Limanov
describe how mabl \"uses machine intelligence to automate visual
insights and make tests more adaptive\".\
\
With their AI, you can train mabl to go on a \"user\'s journey\". Much
like Selenium IDE, the record-and-playback device, you walk the agent on
what you as a tester would like it to focus on. What you want it to
know. What you want it to ignore. It then learns and adapts, learning
how you like to test.\
\
Their product should be launching a free public beta in a few weeks. I
can\'t wait to try it out!\
\
Thank you so much, mabl for having us!\

\
\"John is building intelligent tools that enable developers to create
better software at [mabl](https://www.mabl.com/). He received his B.A.
in Computer Science from Harvard University and his Ph.D. in Computer
Science from Vanderbilt University. His research interests include
machine learning, combinatorial optimization, intelligent agents, and
coordination in multi-agent systems.\
\
\"At Bridj, he led the research and data science group with a focus on
machine learning and AI optimization techniques applied to
transportation modeling, prediction, and optimization for improving mass
transit. His research at Vanderbilt focused on the design of intelligent
pedagogical agents and machine learning techniques to model important
learning behaviors, including metacognition and self-regulated learning
strategies, from activity traces of student interaction in educational
systems\".\
