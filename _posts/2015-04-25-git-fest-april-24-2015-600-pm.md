### [A Bit about Git]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

[Here\'s what I picked up through independent
research: ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
Git is a software configuration management tool written as part of the
Linux project back in 2005. It allows a team of software developers to
work together. You can checkout code from a master branch to your local
machine, such as the MacBook where you are developing code. You can pull
any changes to the master branch down to your development workstation
creating a local branch on your machine. You can commit your changes to
the master branch, adding comments on what code you changed and what
bugs the commit fixes. After the code has been reviewed, you can attempt
to push the changes to the master branch, and hopefully there will not
be any merge conflicts. When developers do a pull from the master onto
their machines, your code changes will be displayed. People can look in
the Git history to see what was changed and when, tracking the life of
the software project.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
On to the first speaker! ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

### [Practicing Git]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

[Zach Shaw,]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
*[Organizer, Boston Software
Craftmanship]{style="font-family: inherit;"}*\
*[Principal Software Engineer for
Brightcove]{style="font-family: inherit;"}*\
[\[ [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyshaw)  \|
[Blog](http://zdsbs.blogspot.com/) \| Twitter:
[\@zdsbs](https://twitter.com/zdsbs) \]]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
The first speaker was Zach Shaw, from the Meetup.com group, [Boston
Software
Craftmanship](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Software-Craftsmanship/),
also known as Boston SC. Boston SC is a monthly group that has been
around for the past four years. Its mission is to host sessions so that
software engineers can improve software development skills through
practice.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
But why practice? And why practice Git?]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
Engineers *want* to practice, but aren\'t sure what to practice, so
these sessions have been set up as a guide. Practice sessions are
usually two hours in length. Typical Boston CS sessions run around 10 to
20 attendees at a time and can scale up to 30. And by \"practice\", Zach
told the audience, he meant going through an exercise just for an
educational purpose. The problem is that with a job doing software
development, you can\'t really experiment. What they work on during the
practice sessions is is something you can delete afterwards. There
isn\'t the pressure programming on the job might
bring.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
Zach asked a few rhetorical questions to the audience: What is Git? Do
you really know what it is and how it works under the covers? Can you
get Git to do what you want? Do you know what your SCM (*Software
Configuration Management*) messages should be like? What is your Git
philosophy? When do you use Git? When do you merge your code into the
master branch? What makes a good branching
strategy?]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

> *[\"Git is all about communication. What does your Git commits tell
> you as a story\"?]{style="font-family: inherit;"}*

[Zach described a [Messaging Exercise in
Git](http://github.com/moss/messaging-exercise) he used in a practice
session.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

> [**From the Messaging Exercise
> site**: ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

> [\"In this coding exercise, you gradually evolve an application for
> sending two different types of messages, emails and IM chats, through
> a network connection. The mechanics of input and output are
> drastically oversimplified (command-line input, and output to one
> single writer that represents different network connections), but are
> just realistic to simulate some of the issues that a real app would
> face. There are a series of end-to-end tests representing eight
> different user stories. All but the first are annotated with \@Ignore.
> Once the first story is complete, remove the \@Ignore from the second
> and start work on it, and so on\".]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

[\
]{style="font-family: inherit;"}[Zach mentioned in this practice
session, people worked with this exercise in teams of three, trying to
produce what they thought was ***the*** idealized git history. They also
tried to figure out what they could do within an hour, then compared
notes on how much they got off course. How big the commits should be and
how small.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
Zach ended that section by asking the
audience:]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

> [*\"The question is\... what is your ideal git commit history, and
> what is your git philosophy\"?*]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

[With the next section of his talk, Zach talked to the audience about
how they could map out the Git process and history using a **Directed
Acyclic Graph**, a way to model
information.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
\... I found a chapter the next day describing [Directed Acyclic
Graphs](http://ericsink.com/vcbe/html/directed_acyclic_graphs.html) in
the online text [**Version Control By
Example**](http://ericsink.com/vcbe/html/) (2011) by Eric
Sink.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
Zach gave a new challenge to the audience: How fast can you be just
manipulating the DAG? He introduced a multimedia course called \"Learn
Git Branching\" at <http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/> by
[Peter
Cottle](http://petermcottle.com/). ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

> *[\"LearnGitBranching is a git repository visualizer, sandbox, and
> series of educational tutorials and challenges. Its primary purpose is
> to help developers understand git through the power of visualization
> (something that\'s absent when working on the command
> line). ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}*

> *[\"You can input a variety of commands into LearnGitBranching (LGB)
> \-- as commands are processed, the nearby commit tree will dynamically
> update to reflect the effects of each command.\" ( README,
> [LearnGitBranching](https://github.com/pcottle/learnGitBranching))]{style="font-family: inherit;"}*

[Zach said these were exercise to run with a group. Group coding
exercises are fun to do, he said.  And after the exercises, he would ask
participants: Did you get more facile with the DAG? Did you learn more
Git commands? People enjoyed improving areas of software
engineering.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
Zach invited everyone to check out Boston Software Craftmanship. They

them out! I wonder if some fellow Fitbit developers might want to walk
over to check it out with me? I need to to remember to ask around the
Boston office\... I earned my degrees a bit under ten years ago but
haven\'t really coded on the job until now. I have a lot of catch up to
do! ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

[\
Merge is panic inducing for people. ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
Out of the box, the only give you out of the box, diff \--git which is
text only and can be very hard to read. There is a GUI you can use,
though, by Perforce called P4Merge that you can
[download](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools).
It is a better three way merge tool.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
1. Download and install P4Merge]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[2.  Add it to your path, such as with a
Mac:]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
\
[export PATH=\${PATH}
:/Applications/p4merge.app/Contents/MacOS]{style="font-family: "courier new" , "courier" , monospace;"}\
[\
3. Configure git to know about it.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
\
[git config \-- global merge.tool
p4merge]{style="font-family: "courier new" , "courier" , monospace;"}\
[git difftool
\--tool-help]{style="font-family: "courier new" , "courier" , monospace;"}\
[\
4. Use it]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
\
[git difftool
some.txt]{style="font-family: "courier new" , "courier" , monospace;"}\
[\
Back in the console, you might see messages mimicking what you are doing
in the GUI. You can turn that off:]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
\
[git difftool \--no-prompt
some.txt]{style="font-family: "courier new" , "courier" , monospace;"}\
[git config mergetool.prompt
off]{style="font-family: "courier new" , "courier" , monospace;"}\
[\
You need to remember to set up the mergetool, not just the diff
tool:]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
\
[git checkout
master]{style="font-family: "courier new" , "courier" , monospace;"}\
[git merge other // where \"other\" is the name of a branch in this
example.]{style="font-family: "courier new" , "courier" , monospace;"}\
[git
mergetool]{style="font-family: "courier new" , "courier" , monospace;"}\
[\
Steve mentioned that he has seen online how people are setting up shell
scripts to tell the tool where the tool is located. You don\'t need a
shell script, just set up the path.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
Once that is done, you can see three way merges, three
panels.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
Let\'s say you do in the Terminal window of your MacBook: git status and
get back that there is a merge conflict. You can start the merge tool by
]{style="font-family: inherit;"}[git
mergetool]{style="font-family: "courier new" , "courier" , monospace;"}[.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
Let\'s say you have \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\" and
you are missing an s at the end. You can compare the three panes. You
can pick the original in the first pane, or the edit in the middle, or
both in the third pane. Now run:]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
\
[git
status]{style="font-family: "courier new" , "courier" , monospace;"}\
[\
Merge conflict is resolved. You can do your commit and your merge is
done. Much better insight to your
merges.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
In the Q&A session, some people asked about using IntelliJ. Steve
mentioned IntelliJ is still a 2-way tool even though it is better than
other 2 way merge tools. Steve mentions if he is already developing with
it, he uses their built-in feature for simple merges. Complex merges,
Steve drops out and uses PForce. The basic commit / add / edit workflow,
it contained in IntelliJ. When he is using the Sublime text editor, he
usually doesn\'t do commits with Sublime\'s built-in features, and he
just drops down to the tool. Simple merges he also does with the command
line.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

[\[ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennsebesta)
\] ]{style="font-family: inherit; font-size: x-small;"}\
[\
Ken started off his talk on Git mentioning how he uses Git\... It isn\'t
the best way, but it is his way. There is a lot of ways to use Git. Some
of his stuff works for him, on his own. His way though is brittle. He is
continously doing ten merges in a row and having it break. \"Weird
integration issues. Not very fun\".]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

> [\"SCM (Software Control Management) is all about history. Why don\'t
> we use it all the way? Atomic commit. Thinking about the future,
> picture yourself looking at the code five years form
> now\".]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

[Ken presented a quote from Peter Hutterer, a software engineer at
Redhat, taken from Peter\'s essay, \"[On Commit
Messages](http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html)\"
 *12/28/2009*]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

> [*\"Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is
> wasteful\".*]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

[\
]{style="font-family: inherit;"}[\
Ken metioned that Git commits should be atomic. If you have two
features, split them in two separate commits. The most atomic commits
possible.It is challenging, to make atomic commits while code is being
modified. The problem is that the whitespace fixes, the style fixes,
they all get jumbled up, and it is difficult to track later what
happened with the code change.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
Ken told the audience: Use a GUI. Don\'t be stubborn. Git comes built-in
with a tool, Git-Gui <http://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui>. It is the same
across platforms, whether they are Mac, Windows or
Linux.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

    different ideas, use two commits.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

functionality. It is educational for the people who follow you on
GitHub. Describe the fix.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

#### [What does a good commit message line look like?]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

-   [The first line should be short: 50 characters or less, almost like
    a Book Title and a subtitle, such as: *Dr. Strangelove or: How I

[Rebasing is good for you. It shows a carefully cultivated history. If
you are doing nothing more than fixing whitespace, he recommends adding
a message such as \"fixed style changes\".  Do one commit for tidying up
the whitespace, then another commit for the actual code change. But if
you goofed up, forgot an \#include statement, just
rebase. ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}
