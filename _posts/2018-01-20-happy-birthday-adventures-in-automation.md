\-\-- When I started this blog three years ago, I still wasn\'t sure how
I ever was going to switch from manual testing to automation
development. I kept trying to switch departments at my previous company
for years, but never had much luck. Then the layoff happened, and I
found myself job searching after five years, finding that much of the
software testing job market in Boston had changed.\
\
I talked over with my wife my idea of postponing job searching for two
months, living off of my severance pay, while I re-learned how to code
and studied automation development \-- one last big push to try to cross
over.\
\
This time, I did things a bit differently:\
\

-   Taking [Alan Richardson](http://eviltester.com/)\'s online course,
    [Selenium WebDriver with Java](http://unow.be/at/webdriverapi) for
    the third time in three years, this time instead of simply listening
    and taking notes on his material, I made sure to type out code out
    as he did in his video lessons, causing things to finally stick in
    my mind.
-   I placed my results, a basic automation framework on my [new GitHub
    account](https://github.com/tjmaher).
-   My wife suggested I turn my copious amount of automation research
    notes into a blog. I wrote my first few articles that January: [What
    is a QA
    Engineer](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/01/the-life-of-manual-tester.html),
    [Waterfall + QA](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/01/waterfall-qa.html),
    [Before
    Waterfall](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/01/before-waterfall.html),
    and [Agile Software
    Development](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/01/agile-software-development.html).

Now, I was able to go on interviews and talk intelligently about how to
put together a rudimentary automation framework, and point to code that
I had written. After a tough three months, I landed my first automation
development position.\
\
Since then, it has been a fun-filled three years, learning about
automation, [capturing what I have been learning on this
blog](http://www.tjmaher.com/p/programming-projects.html):\
**\
2015**: I started this blog, and my first automation development
position with Selenium WebDriver and Java testing the user interface of
eCommerce software.\
\
**2016**: The editor of TeachBeacon.com, after discovering this blog,
recruited me to write my first published article for his tech magazine.
I started [digging into REST API testing with
Stripe](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/coming-up-how-to-work-with-rest-apis.html).
By the end of 2016 I am using Selenium with Node.JS with Nightwatch.js.\
\
**2017**: I become the Meetup Organizer of the newly rebranded [Ministry
of Testing - Boston](http://bit.ly/mot_boston) \-- the first time I was
the main person in charge of a Meetup group. Through social media
campaigns I grow membership from 300 to 600 people in the first six
months. I hosted 21 of the 30 Meetup events on our calendar. I also
obtained a contract putting together a proof-of-concept of a mobile
testing framework using Appium + Java.\
\
**2018:** January 2018 I [launched a YouTube
channel](http://bit.ly/tj_youtube) based on this blog! **Feel free to
Subscribe!** The Ministry of Testing - Boston hits 900 members. I also
found a permanent job writing automation at the webservice and RESTful
API layer, using service virtualization using
[Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/) + Kitchen.\
\
All these successes I have had are due to this blog.\
\
A blog post on job interviews [became an
article](http://bit.ly/tj_techbeacon), a talk I [gave to a new
Meetup](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/11/video-10172016-how-to-pass-coding.html),
and was developed into an [online conference
talk](http://automationguild.com/) a year later.\
\
Thank you, dear reader, for all of your support.\
\
And thank you, most of all, to my wonderful wife, Melissa. Thank you for
spending the past seven years with me, and for marrying me
five-and-a-half year ago. My life is what it is because of you.\
