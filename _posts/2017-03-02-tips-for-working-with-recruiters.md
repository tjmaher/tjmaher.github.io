\-\-- Although I have been [working with
recruiters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjmaher1/) ever since the
dot.com boom, starting my software testing career as a QA Consultant at
Oracle\'s Waltham, MA office back in August of 1996, I never really knew
what a recruiter\'s life was like on the other end of the telephone.\

-   What was their day-to-day life like at work? 
-   What did they like about their job? What did they dislike about it?
    What did they wish would improve?
-   Did they have any advice for candidates on making the interview
    process smoother, from the phone screenings to the in-person
    interviews?
-   It\'s tough out there for manual testers who follow traditional
    non-coding QA roles. Did they have any tips?
-   And, not to press my luck, but did they have any tips on negotiating
    salary? 

\
\... As a new co-organizer of the [Ministry of Testing - Boston
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston), I felt it
was my duty to found out.\
\
Over the weekend, I drafted and sent out a Google Forms survey, [How
Boston Recruiters See The Software Testing Industry
2017](https://goo.gl/forms/ZOz2s8YmU9AE34qD2) to every recruiter I have
spoken to in the past two years. Below is the response I received from
half of the two-man team that placed me in a position last Fall: [Mitch
Kurker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-kurker-21487248/) and [Rob
Wall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertwall2/), at Modis IT - Boston.\

-   *Are you a Boston recruiter who places QA people? We\'d love
    to [hear what you think](https://goo.gl/forms/WQAAMkNZT1DdCEXk2)! *
-   *Respondents will be able to list their recruiting company [on the
    Ministry of Testing - Boston
    site](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/pages/22471005/Boston_Recruiters/).*

    relating to the [Boston Recruiter Survey

**Name**: Mitchell Kurker\
**Title**: Executive Recruiter, Technology\
**Company**: [Modis -
Boston](http://www.modis.com/locations/massachusetts/boston/), almost
two years\
**Studied at:** University of Massachusetts at Amherst - Isenberg School
of Management\
**LinkedIn**: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-kurker-21487248/>\
\
**How Does Your Company Stand Out From The Crowd?:** *\"Personally, I
think it is more about the individual you are working with rather than
the company that recruiter works at. With so many agencies out there, so
many are alike, but so few recruiters are.\"*\

About The Recruiter
-------------------

<div>

**\
**

</div>

<div>

**How Long Have You Been a Recruiter? How Many Years in the Business?**\
\
\"I\'m coming up on 2 years as an Executive Recruiter. This is my first
job after graduating college\".\

<div>

\
**What is a typical day for you?**\
**\
**\"My typical day is split between working with clients and hiring
managers to understand their hiring needs or potential projects coming
down the road. The other 50% is spent identifying, sourcing, and meeting
with potential candidates for said roles\".

</div>

<div>

\
**What do you love about your job?**\
\
\"I love working with people. Almost 100% of my business is done in
person. I meet with every client and company I\'m working with to
understand their culture, and at the same time, I do my best to meet
with every candidate in person who may be a fit. This is to ensure a
long-term match for culture and personality. I also love the
satisfaction of finding potential candidates their next great career
move! My favorite part about my job is receiving referrals from clients
or candidates because this means I\'m doing my job the right way and
providing great customer service\". 

</div>

<div>

**\
What do you hate about your job, and would you mind if I quote you on
that?**\
\
\"I hate when a client or candidate thinks I\'ve failed them. Everyone
makes mistakes and I\'m not perfect, but I do my best to handle each
client and candidate on an individual basis and give them my best effort
and attention. As busy as this job can be, that does not always happen,
however that is no excuse!\"\
\

About The Interview Process: Got Any Advice?
--------------------------------------------

**Job placement can be tricky, from cold calling potential resources,
screening applicants, setting them up with interviews, and negotiating
the final offers. Do you have any advice you would give to software
testers?**

</div>

<div>

**\
For the Initial Phone Screen with the Recruiter**\
\
\"Be yourself and keep things casual. We are not the enemy :) we\'re
here to help you and learn about you as a technologist and as a person.
Whenever a candidate has their guard up when speaking with me, it\'s not
so much a \'red flag\' for me not to work with them, but instead, I know
there must have been a bad experience at some point that I would like to
hear about so I don\'t give that candidate the same bad experience\".

</div>

<div>

\
**For the Initial Phone Screen with the Client Company**\
\
\"Use your recruiter for preparation! I do my best to learn the ins and
outs of each position, the hiring manager, his/her team, and the overall
company culture. This is why we do things in person. Recruiters can not
make you a great technologists or give you the answers to the test, but
we can do our best to give you as much artillery as possible to \'win
the interview\' assuming we know our clients very well\".

</div>

<div>

\
**For Interviewing with the Client Company On-Site**\
\
\"Dress to impress. I always suggest business professional, unless
specifically instructed otherwise. First impressions are everything, and
appearance is that first impression. Also, do your research on the
company. If you\'re getting an on-site interview, chances are you\'re
somewhat technically qualified. At this point, it\'s important to
impress the hiring manager with your knowledge of their overall business
& industry\". 

</div>

<div>

\
**For Negotiating Salary**\
\
\"Trust your recruiter. Our clients pay us a percentage of your base
salary, so it is in our best interest to get you the highest offer
possible. At the same time, we understand the market, and this is where
our expertise comes in handy. We do our best to get a candidate their
ideal target salary, while not pricing them out of the market demand. Be
open with your recruiter about what you\'re currently making, what your
high-end target salary is, and the low-end salary that you\'d
potentially consider after going through the entire process.
Communication is key to be sure you and your recruiter are on the same
page!\"\
\

</div>

About Manual Testing
--------------------

<div>

**\
How difficult is it for manual testers to find work?**\
\
\"2017 is a candidate driven market. I suggest manual testers expand
into automation, to be as marketable as possible, but with how low
unemployment is in the tech industry, jobs are aplenty for good talent
in general!\"

</div>

<div>

\
**Do you have any advice for manual testers?**\
\
\"Some industries where I see the demand for manual testers currently
are in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. But that is always
changing, and so should candidate skill sets. Candidates should always
be exposing themselves to new technologies and challenges\".\
\

Parting Thoughts
----------------

</div>

<div>

**\
Any Last Comments You May Want To Add?**

</div>

\
\"I suggest keeping an open mind with every recruiter you have a
meaningful connection with. I understand how often candidates are
contacted about the next great role - we recruiters get those messages
quite a bit as well. For direct-hire positions, you never know when that
next great role will come, or when you\'re suddenly without a job.
Having a large and trusted network of recruiters who truly understand
what motivates you and what you\'re looking for is going to be the best
way for you to land your next amazing position, or get back into the
work force as quickly as possible without having to \'settle\' for any
old job\".\
