Graham ( [\@DorothyGraham](https://twitter.com/dorothygraham) ), a
software tester for over forty years, spoke at theÂ [STAR
East](https://stareast.techwell.com/) Virtual Conference, a TechWell
Event broadcasted from Orlando, FL, Wednesday May 4th, 2016 during the
Lightning Talks section, \"Lightning Strikes the Keynotes\". The
following is a (mostly) accurate transcript of her talk, taken by T.J.

\"Test automation is sooo easy.\
\

<div>

\"Let me rephrase that. Test automation seems to be really easy, at
first. You can see your first demo, you write your first test \[\...\]
and it looks so easy!\
\
\"But if you want a long lasting asset for your company \[\...\] that\'s
a different matter altogether. It\'s like the difference between seeing
some low hanging fruit, and picking the fruit off the tree and thinking,
\'Wow, that was easy. This is so good!\' and the other aspect: What if
you want to build an orchard to grow enough fruit to feed a small town?
It\'s an entirely different matter.\
\
[]{#more}\
\
\"First of all you need to decide \'What fruit am I going to grow? What
sort of trees do I want?\' You have to consider things like, what are
the soil conditions like. What\'s the climate like? And also, what\'s
the market like? Because you want to make sure that people will buy your
fruit after you have grown it.\
\
\"In terms of automation, you need to decide which tools do you want,
which tests do you want to automate, and what\'s the company culture
like. And what\'s the market \-- what\'s the value \-- the automated
test is going to provide to your business.\
\
\"Then you need to grow the trees, and that takes time. Automation grows
faster, but that taks time, and while they are growing you need to prune
the trees so they are stronger and healthier. If you don\'t do that,
they won\'t provide as much fruit.\
\
\"With the automation, you also need to prune your tests, because they
seem to get all straggly if you don\'t pay attention to that.\
\
\"And you might have some pests. Bugs! Does that got anything to do with
automation? Bugs in the automation code? Bugs in the tools? Horrors!
\... Yes, it does happen.\
\
\"And you might also have diseases. Your trees might get sick. They may
not be producing good fruit anymore, so therefore you are going to have
to do something about it. Maybe you\'ll have to chop down one of the
trees. But if you don\'t, it will spread to the whole orchard and
everything will be sick, and you will lose everything. And with the
automation, sometimes you need to do something drastic. You may need to
refactor your automation.\
\
\"Then you have to pick your fruit. Maybe you can get a machine to do
that. \[\...\] Testing tools can help, but they don\'t replace people.
Test execution tools don\'t do testing. They just run stuff.\
\
\"And now we need to pack the fruit so it will survive the trip to the
grocery store or wherever, and make sure the structure is fine so it
won\'t arrive bruised. We need to make sure we structure our automation
so that it will survive changes to it. It will survive changes to the
application and changes to the tool, and run on different platforms.\
\
\"And what about marketing and selling? If we don\'t sell our fruit then
we are not going to make money out of our orchard. We have different
roles involved. We have to market and sell the automation and make the
benefits visible to managers.\
\
\"And what about expectations? Maybe our local supermarket manager has
heard somewhere that the fruit you are growing will cure all his
diseases and will make him able to jump tall buildings in a single
bound\... Well, that\'s great! Your first sale will be really easy,
right? \... But after that? It might be a little bit more difficult.\
\
\"So, if you are going to grow your own automation, remember that it
does take time. Remember that there will be problems and you will need
to deal with them. Remember that you\'re not just dealing with technical
issues but also with people issues to do with managers as well as
testers along with automaters.\
\
\"But there can be great results. So I hope that your automation
results\... are fruitful.\"\
