When I started this blog three years ago, I still wasn't sure how I ever was going to switch from manual testing to automation development. I kept trying to switch departments at my previous company for years, but never had much luck. Then the layoff happened, and I found myself job searching after five years, finding that much of the software testing job market in Boston had changed.<br /><br />I talked over with my wife my idea of postponing job searching for two months, living off of my severance pay, while I re-learned how to code and studied automation development -- one last big push to try to cross over.<br /><br />This time, I did things a bit differently:<br /><br /><ul><li>Taking <a href="http://eviltester.com/" target="_blank">Alan Richardson</a>'s online course, <a href="http://unow.be/at/webdriverapi" target="_blank">Selenium WebDriver with Java</a> for the third time in three years, this time instead of simply listening and taking notes on his material, I made sure to type out code out as he did in his video lessons, causing things to finally stick in my mind.</li><li>I placed my results, a basic automation framework on my <a href="https://github.com/tjmaher" target="_blank">new GitHub account</a>.</li><li>My wife suggested I turn my copious amount of automation research notes into a blog. I wrote my first few articles that January: <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/01/the-life-of-manual-tester.html" target="_blank">What is a QA Engineer</a>, <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/01/waterfall-qa.html" target="_blank">Waterfall&nbsp;+ QA</a>, <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/01/before-waterfall.html" target="_blank">Before Waterfall</a>, and <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/01/agile-software-development.html" target="_blank">Agile Software Development</a>.</li></ul>Now, I was able to go on interviews and talk intelligently about how to put together a rudimentary automation framework, and point to code that I had written. After a tough three months, I landed my first automation development position.<br /><br />Since then, it has been a fun-filled three years, learning about automation, <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/p/programming-projects.html" target="_blank">capturing what I have been learning on this blog</a>:<br /><b><br /></b><b>2015</b>: I started this blog, and my first automation development position with Selenium WebDriver and Java testing the user interface of eCommerce software.<br /><br /><b>2016</b>: The editor of TeachBeacon.com, after discovering this blog, recruited me to write my first published article for his tech magazine. I started <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/coming-up-how-to-work-with-rest-apis.html" target="_blank">digging into REST API testing with Stripe</a>. By the end of 2016 I am using Selenium with Node.JS with Nightwatch.js.<br /><br /><b>2017</b>: I become the Meetup Organizer of the newly rebranded <a href="http://bit.ly/mot_boston" target="_blank">Ministry of Testing - Boston</a> -- the first time I was the main person in charge of a Meetup group. Through social media campaigns I grow membership from 300 to 600 people in the first six months. I hosted 21 of the 30 Meetup events on our calendar. I also obtained a contract putting together a proof-of-concept of a mobile testing framework using Appium&nbsp;+ Java.<br /><br /><b>2018:</b>&nbsp;January 2018 I <a href="http://bit.ly/tj_youtube" target="_blank">launched a YouTube channel</a> based on this blog! <b>Feel free to Subscribe!</b>&nbsp;The Ministry of Testing - Boston hits 900 members. I also found a permanent job writing automation at the webservice and RESTful API layer, using service virtualization using <a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/" target="_blank">Chef</a>&nbsp;+ Kitchen.<br /><br />All these successes I have had are due to this blog.<br /><br />A blog post on job interviews <a href="http://bit.ly/tj_techbeacon" target="_blank">became an article</a>, a talk I <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/11/video-10172016-how-to-pass-coding.html" target="_blank">gave to a new Meetup</a>, and was developed into an <a href="http://automationguild.com/" target="_blank">online conference talk</a> a year later.<br /><br />Thank you, dear reader, for all of your support.<br /><br />And thank you, most of all, to my wonderful wife, Melissa. Thank you for spending the past seven years with me, and for marrying me five-and-a-half year ago. My life is what it is because of you.<br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Happy Testing! </span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">-T.J.
