\-\-- A few months ago, [SmartBear](http://smartbear.com/), maker of
automated testing tools such as
[ReadyAPI](https://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/overview/),
[SoapUI](https://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/soapui/overview/),
sponsored a [Ministry of Testing -
Boston](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/06/are-you-software-tester-take-state-of.html) meetup,
encouraging us to spread the word on their new survey about the State of
the Software Testing Industry. Over five thousand people filled out the
survey. The results are ready to be revealed!\
\
\"Did you know that 63% of testers are responsible for testing both the
frontend and backend of their applications? Or that API tests are more
likely to be automated than GUI tests?\
\
\"Discover what your peers are doing today in testing - the applications
they're building and the techniques they're using. Learn more about
modern test environments and how many teams are at the 'tipping point'
of shifting left.\
\
\"SmartBear collected insights from thousands of developers, testers,
and managers worldwide who are passionate about software testing. They
openly shared their experiences, insights, and the challenges they face
in their day-to-day roles.\
\
\"Join a panel of SmartBear experts as they walk through the 2017 'State
of Testing Survey' and divulge the key trends and observations we
uncovered\".\

\
One of the general trends they talked about is how Automated testing is
starting to include not just the UI tests, but also writing automation
at the webservice or API layer.\
\
Their thought is that you can never replace manual testing, not would
you want to, especially when attempting to determine the usability of a
front-end design. Checking the GUI is a task perfect for a human,
attempting to take in a lot of data at once.\

**SmartBear: The State of Testing Survey 2017**\

\
[*http://smartbear.com/SmartBear/media/ebooks/The-State-of-Testing-2017\_Report\_Final.pdf*](http://smartbear.com/SmartBear/media/ebooks/The-State-of-Testing-2017_Report_Final.pdf)\
\
\
Where there was room for growth was in performing REST API testing, and
with techniques such as service virtualization: emulate the behavior of
the production systems during testing, generating the simulated
responses from third party systems.\
\
**What type of Testing Methodologies Do People Use?**\

-   Service Virtualization: 12%
-   Performance Testing: 56%
-   Automated UI Testing: 62%
-   Unit Testing: 72%

\
Very few teams are using service virtualization to reduce dependencies,
such as with Mocking and Stubbing.\
\
**What Languages Do People Use To Code or Create Scripts For Automated
Testing?**\
\
\"Java is the most popular scripting language among participants, with
62% of respondents using it to write code or create test scripts. Java,
PHP, Python, and Groovy are the languages most likely to be used among
API testers. Survey participants responsible for both API and UI testing
are more likely to use Python and JavaScript\".\

\
**\
Manual Testing:**\
\

-   Right now, 58% of the respondents are still using manual testing ...
    SmartBear believes it will become more valuable, when paired up with
    Exploratory Testing, which is used by 45%. 

\
\
\
Happy Testing!\
