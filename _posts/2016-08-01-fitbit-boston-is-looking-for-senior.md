\-\-- Fitbit-Boston is looking for Senior Software Engineer for their
new Software Test Engineering department.\
\
Taken from Fitbit\'s [job
posting](https://www.fitbit.com/jobs/search#jobs/oJ801fwC):\

> \"Effective Automated testing is essential to agile software
> development. All software developers write tests, but some kinds of
> testing present unique challenges. Fitbit is looking for people with
> the skills of a good Software Engineering  and the mindset of a tester
> to solve testing challenges for our teams and raise the bar for test
> automation at Fitbit\".\
> \
> \"As a Senior Software Engineer on the Software Test Engineering Team
> at Fitbit you will work as part of a product Scrum team on a sprint-by
> sprint basis to identify appropriate testing strategies, help
> integrate testing frameworks, and solve testing challenges. Your goal
> will be to enable the other members of the team to improve automated
> test coverage.\"

\
Note: Fitbit is not looking for automation developers. Fitbit-Boston is
looking for Senior Software Engineers who have five years experience in
languages such as Java, Scala, and Groovy. See
<https://www.fitbit.com/jobs/search#jobs/oJ801fwC> for more
information.\
\
\... In other news, does any company in Boston need an automation
developer familiar with writing automated test frameworks in Selenium
WebDriver / Java? See the [Table of
Contents](http://www.tjmaher.com/p/table-of-contents.html) of this site
to see my skill set.\
