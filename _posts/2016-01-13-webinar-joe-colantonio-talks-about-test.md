Test Automation Trends for 2016 and Beyond
------------------------------------------

### ***Staying Employable In Changing Times***

Sauce Labs Webinar\
*1/12/2016: 2:00 pm: *\
*Joe Colantonio, [TestTalks.com](http://testtalks.com/)*\
\
Coding isn\'t the hard part of my role of being a brand-new automation
engineer. Although I\'m in my forties getting into development for the
first time, I am actually doing okay \-- in spite of always stressing
out about the fact that grad school was a decade ago. I've now been
writing automation scripts in Java and WebDriver for a year coming this
March. Do anything for a year and you start becoming more comfortable
with it.\
\
It\'s keeping up with the latest trends in automated software testing,
now that is the hard part!\
\
[]{#more}\
\
It was only a year ago that I had the nagging fear that because my sole
knowledge base was manual testing, my entire software testing career was
*dead, dead, dead*. This has since been replaced with other nagging
fears: *Can I keep up with the industry standard*? Is what I am doing
now the industry standard? *Is there, in fact, an automated testing
industry standard*? I\'m not privy to what other companies are doing.
I've never worked as an automation developer for any other companies
besides the one I am working for now. It is hard to plot out a graph
with only a single point of data.\
\
That is why I was so excited to hear from the Sauce Labs mailing list
that they would be hosting a webinar on test automation trends for 2016,
to be given by Joe Colantonio from TestTalks.\
\
After doing a bit of research about the speaker, I was quite excited to
hear what Joe had to say about software testing, and registered for the
Sauce Labs Webinar immediately.\

### **About Joe Colantonio**

\
Joe Colantonio a prolific writer and blogger who ---  according to his
[LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joecolantonio) --- has been
in the software testing field for the past fifteen years at places such
as Verisign and GE Healthcare. His main site, "**Joe Colantonio:
Automation Awesomeness**" at <http://www.joecolantonio.com/> connects
to:\

-   **TestTalks:**  Mr. Colantonio\'s podcast is now up to the 85th
    episode, which interviewing Dave Haeffner about his Selenium
    Guidebook - Java edition. Sauce Labs is the exclusive sponsor of
    TestTalks\... I wonder how long it would take to listen to all of
    them on my commute to and from work?
-   **Automation Awesomeness: **Mr. Colantonio\'s blog has been going
    since July 4, 2010, when he talked about [Mercury
    WinRunner](http://www.joecolantonio.com/2010/07/07/the-top-10-signs-that-you%e2%80%99re-an-old-time-mercury-winrunner-automation-engineer/) and
    [Quick Test
    Pro](http://www.joecolantonio.com/2010/08/12/quicktest-object-recognition/)
    (QTP) 

\
I was so excited about the talk, I booked a conference room at my
workplace and streamed the presentation so the rest of the automation
team could listen in.\

**[\
]{.underline}[My Notes on the Talk:]{.underline}**\
\
Joe Colantonio started the talk by joking that the reason he has his
blog is so that he can stay employed. It is so tough to keep up with the
latest trends, so now with his blogs and his podcasts, he is forced to
stay in the loop with current trends.\
\

### Staying in Touch With Current Trends

\
How Mr. Colantonio stays in tune with the current trends:\
\
**Indeed.com Trends:**\
<http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends>\

-   You can plug any job search keywords in and see how the buzzwords
    are trending upward or downwards. 

\
**Google Trends:**\
<https://www.google.com/trends/>\

-   Take a look at what other people have been searching for over time. 

\
**Github:**\
<https://github.com/>\

-   Have an open-source product? Everyone stores their source code here,
    free to explore. You have [Angular
    2](https://github.com/angular/angular),
    [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)  and of course
    [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium). It even has the
    W3C spec for WebDriver API and Wire Protocol at
    <https://github.com/w3c/webdriver>.

\
**\
World Quality Report 2015-2016**\
<https://www.capgemini.com/thought-leadership/world-quality-report-2015-16>\

-   *From Capgemini Consulting*: \"The speed of digital transformation
    and the reduction of time-to-market life cycles for products and
    services raise the importance of Quality Assurance (QA) and Testing
    for organizations worldwide. How have they been adapting to meet the
    needs of today's digital environment?\" A four minute intro video
    and a summary is on the site. You can sign up to get an email link
    to download their free 80 page PDF.

\
**\
Zephyr Annual Report**\

-   \"Zephyr is an on-demand, cloud based Test Management Platform with
    innovative applications and unparalleled, metrics based visibility
    via real time dashboards.\" Zephyr also publishes an annual PDF,
    \"How The World Tests\" at
     <http://go.getzephyr.com/HowTheWorldTestReports>. If you do not
    want to sign up for the PDF it also has an
    [Insights](http://www.getzephyr.com/insights) section talking about
    trends in the testing industry. 

\
**State of Testing Reports**\

-   Every year, PractiTest on their QABlog at
    <http://qablog.practitest.com/state-of-testing/> asks testers to
    fill out a survey. You can get the results of the 2015 survey in
    [PDF](http://www.practitest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/State_of_Testing_Survey_2015.pdf)
     format. Take the State of Testing 2016 survey!

\

### Testing Has Changed. Testing Keeps Changing. 

\
On my blog, I\'ve mentioned about [Waterfall +
QA](https://www.blogger.com/www.tjmaher.com/2015/01/waterfall-qa.html),
[Before Waterfall](/2015/01/before-waterfall.html) and [Agile Software
Development](/2015/01/agile-software-development.html).\
\
**Before**: Joe Colantonio pointed out, that with Waterfall, we were all
siloed: From Business Analysts creating the requirements to Developers
writing the code, to Testers / QA. It was a process in serial, slowly
making its way from the left to the right.\
\

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   [![](http://www.joecolantonio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WereAllTesters1.png){width="400" height="294"}](http://www.joecolantonio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WereAllTesters1.png)
                                           *Joe Colantonio, [We\'re All Testers Now](http://www.joecolantonio.com/2015/11/03/were-all-testers-now/)*
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
**Now**: we are developer tests and ops / production.\
\
** In the Future**: DEV + Test + Ops will all be working together\
\
Joe quoted a guest on his show, [Paul
Gerrard](http://gerrardconsulting.com/?q=blog), a software testing
consultant who demoed at EuroSTAR 2015, \"[A New Model For
Testing](https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1coPQqo-8E)\":\
\

> ["Testing is not a role - its an activity with a deliverable." - *Paul
> Gerrard*]{style="font-size: x-large;"}

\
\... Whether the developer or tester is doing it, testing needs to be
done.\
\

### SHIFT +LEFT

Mr. Colantonio introduced the new trend of \"Shifting Left\". With
Waterfall, everything used to be siloed Business Analysts did their
work, Developers did theirs, and Testers did theirs. With Agile work,
there Job responsibilities had to shift\... and they did. They shifted
left. Everyone needs to be a tester.  Testing is up front, not just at
the end.\
\
I found another article explaining it further: **What is Shift Left
Testing?**\

> \"In the past, most traditional test automation focused on the UI and
> not the back-end. This was a leftover mindset from the days of \'just
> throw it over the wall\'. With the current shift in how teams are
> organized, the skillset for testing is evolving. Dev/Ops, continuous
> delivery, mobile, cloud and the Internet of Things is forcing a rapid
> pace of development. Now, QA professionals and business analysts are
> more ingrained in the overall development process from start to
> finish. Now that software development for different platforms are
> using a \'shift-left\' approach (which involves moving testing to
> earlier in the software development lifecycle), it is requiring test
> automation engineers to enhance their technical skills\" *From
> <https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/8653/145355>*

\
Mr. Colantonio mentioned other trends he had noticed were *Using DevOps
principles,* and *Configuration Management Automation* with tools such
as with *Chef* and *Puppet*. I did a bit of independent research on
these terms:\
\

-   **About Puppet: **<https://puppetlabs.com/about>

> \"Puppet Labs is the leader in IT automation. Our software helps
> sysadmins automate configuration and management of machines and the
> software running on them. With our software, businesses can make
> rapid, repeatable changes and automatically enforce the consistency of
> systems and devices, across physical and virtual machines, on prem or
> in the cloud\".

-   **About Chef: **<https://www.chef.io/about/>

> \"We are Chef. We are IT automation for speed and awesomeness. We give
> you a model for automating IT infrastructure and applications that
> drive self-reliance across your development and operations teams. We
> are the Chef Community. We are tens of thousands strong. We are
> helping your businesses become faster, safer and more flexible, so you
> win in today\'s 24x7 digital economy. Join our movement today\".

-   **About DevOps: **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps>

> \"DevOps (a clipped compound of \"development\" and \"operations\") is
> a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and
> communication of both software developers and other
> information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process
> of software delivery and infrastructure changes. It aims at
> establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and
> releasing software, can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably.
>  

> \"\[\...\] At the Agile 2008 conference, Andrew Clay Shafer and
> Patrick Debois discussed \'Agile Infrastructure\'. The term \'DevOps\'
> was popularized through a series of *devopsdays* starting in 2009 in
> Belgium. Since then, there have been *devopsdays* conferences held in
> many countries worldwide. 

> \"Tools such as Docker and Jenkins have automated more quality
> assurance processes and releases by development team. Puppet and
> automated configuration tools like Vagrant have also been used and
> frequently referenced in DevOps discussions.\"

-   **About Continuous Integration**, according
    to [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration): 

> \"Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires
> developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a
> day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing
> teams to detect problems early. 

> \"Because you're integrating so frequently, there is significantly
> less back-tracking to discover where things went wrong, so you can
> spend more time building features. 

> \"Continuous Integration is cheap. Not continuously integrating is
> costly. If you don't follow a continuous approach, you'll have longer
> periods between integrations. This makes it exponentially more
> difficult to find and fix problems. Such integration problems can
> easily knock a project off-schedule, or cause it to fail altogether\".

### Shift + Right

Mr. Colantonio pointed out that not only is it Shift + Left, where
everyone is a tester. It is is also Shift + Right, where everyone is a
developer.\
\
Automation should be as fast as possible. Going through text based
reports? Joe suggested writing python scripts to go through the
reports.\

###  Other Trends

\
**TDD/BDD** 39%. We want to make sure that products and code wows our
customers. Using behavior driven development should not be just an
automation tool. It speaks about requirement as early as possible. When
I ama user, I should go to the page and get this result. You can use an
English syntax, and talk about the requirements.\
\

-   **About Test Driven Development**, from
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development):

> \"Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that
> relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the
> developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that
> defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the
> minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the
> new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with
> having developed or \'rediscovered\' the technique, stated in 2003
> that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence. 

> \"Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming
> concepts of extreme programming, begun in 1999, but more recently has
> created more general interest in its own right.\"

-   **[Behavior Driven
    Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) example**:

> **Story**: Returns go to stock 

> **In order to** keep track of stock 

> As a store owner\
> I want to add items back to stock when they\'re returned 

> **Scenario 1**: Refunded items should be returned to stock\
> Given a customer previously bought a black sweater from me\
> And I currently have three black sweaters left in stock\
> When he returns the sweater for a refund\
> Then I should have four black sweaters in stock

\
With TDD you need to get developers who love to test.\
\

### Vendor Tools

**\
**Mr. Colantonio noted that **Selenium WebDriver** is THE tool that
people are using, around 45%.\
QTP / UFT (Quick Test Pro /  Unified Functional Test): Only 10% are
using. *Want more info? See on HP\'s site, [UFT is the new
QTP](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/unified-functional-automated-testing/?originid=510031224&jumpid=ps_8s4zmetvpw&gclid=CNHEiNTzpcoCFc5MNwod86oBZA&gclsrc=ds)*.\
\
Selenium is morphing with Vendor tools, such as **SmartBear
TestComplete, HP LeanFT, Teller Test Studio**. Vendor Tools act as a
wrapper around Selenium. These tools import the Selenium WebDriver API.\

                                              *Joe Colantonio, [Selenium and Vendor Based Tools](http://www.joecolantonio.com/2015/11/17/selenium-and-vendor-based-tools/)*
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **About SmartBear TestComplete**:
    <http://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/overview/>

> \"TestComplete is a functional automated testing platform developed by
> SmartBear Software. TestComplete gives testers the ability to create
> automated tests for Microsoft Windows, Web, Android (operating
> system), and iOS applications. Tests can be recorded, scripted or
> manually created with keyword driven operations and used for automated
> playback and error logging. \[\...\] TestComplete is broken out into
> three modules: Desktop, Web, Mobile \[\...\]\"

-   **About HP LeanFT**: Press release [on June 2,
    2015](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=1998066#.VpXNqxUrK70):

> \"Businesses today must act with speed and agility, and continuously
> capitalize on opportunities to deliver new solutions and experiences,
> business models, and revenue streams. In software development, this
> has fueled the rise of Agile methodology, which embraces a continuous
> delivery process, rather than a phased, sequential approach. For
> software testing, this means developers and testers seek to \'shift
> left,\' and continuously test their applications much earlier in the
> application development lifecycle. 

> \"HP LeanFT embraces the **shift left** concept by leveraging the key
> tools of the modern Agile developer ecosystem. Powerful, lightweight,
> and cost-effective, HP LeanFT is built specifically for continuous
> testing and continuous delivery, and fits naturally into existing
> ecosystems (such as Microsoft TFS, GIT, and Subversion) and frameworks
> that support test driven and behavior driven development\". 

-   **Teller Test Studio**: <http://www.telerik.com/teststudio>

> *From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Studio)*:
> \"Telerik Test Studio is a Windows-based software testing tool for web
> and desktop, functional testing, software performance testing,load
> testing and mobile application testing developed by Telerik. The tool
> ships with a plugin for Visual Studio and a standalone app that use
> the same repositories and file formats. Test Studio supports HTML,
> AJAX, Silverlight, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript and WPF. Test Studio
> supports test execution in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and
> Chrome\".

\
Why all these vendor tools wrapping around Selenium? I had understood
that the W3C is working on a [web driver
standard](/2015/12/new-editors-draft-of-w3c-webdriver.html), but what I
hadn\'t realize was that once web driver is a standard, all companies
need to support it. Since WebDriver is nothing more than an API, other
programs can use it, placing it in a user-friendly interface.\
\

### Gartner\'s Magic Quadrant for Software Test Automation 2015

\
If you are looking for industry standards, Joe Colantonio brought up The
Gartner\'s Report, [Magic Quadrant for Software Test Automation
