\-\-- When I first started this blog, my undergrad and grad school
degrees in computer science and software engineering were gathering
dust! What a difference a few years makes.\
\
This blog started way back when I was still trying to break into the
automated testing field. It became more than that once I was hired at
Fitbit-Boston, embedded in the team developing **automated test
frameworks**. I started writing about:\

-   Setting up a development environment with [IntelliJ
    / Maven](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/05/webdriver-development-environment-setup.html),
    then with IntelliJ / Gradle, then [Eclipse /
    Gradle](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/06/webdriver-development-environment-setup.html). 
-   Taking a [deeper dive into
    Gradle](http://www.tjmaher.com/search/label/Gradle), exploring
    [Groovy](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/06/building-test-framework-with-gradle.html),
    using it to run simple tests.
-   Using both
    [TestNG](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/01/automate-amazon-sketch-of-possible-data.html)
    and
    [JUnit4](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/06/webdriver-development-environment-setup.html) ways
    of making assertions. Suddenly,
    [Hamcrest](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/05/webdriver-development-environment-setup.html).
-   Abstracting the page using the [Page
    Object](http://www.tjmaher.com/search/label/Page%20Object) model.
-   Using [CSS
    Selectors](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/04/how-selenium-webdriver-uses-css.html)
    to find and manipulate web elements on the page.
-   How to organize the web element selectors: first in
    [enums](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/07/storing-locators-for-web-elements.html),
    then in By statements.
-   [Wrapping Selenium
    calls](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/12/automate-amazon-commonutils-methods-and.html),
    placing them in a CommonUtils library.
-   Doing away with wrapping Selenium calls and just using [Page
    Factory.](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/06/page-factories-setting-up-creating-them.html)
-   Performing API testing with Apache\'s [HTTP
    Components](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/restful-testing-with-stripe-brief.html) and
    [cURL](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/restful-testing-with-stripe-interacting.html).
-   Passing data to tests using
    [pojos](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/01/automate-amazon-productenums-and.html)
    and [builder
    patterns](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/04/why-use-builder-pattern-examples-of.html),
-   Showing examples of [good
    logging](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/do-you-actually-know-what-your.html)
    for tests.
-   Experiments with setting up a virtual dev environment with
    [VirtualBox, Vagrant, and
    Docker](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/05/setting-up-virtual-dev-environment-with.html).
-   Coming up with various [programming
    projects](http://www.tjmaher.com/p/programming-projects.html), and
    uploading the source code to [GitHub](https://github.com/tjmaher).

As a manual tester, I loved getting paid to explore and understand new
technologies, see how they do (or don\'t) work. As an automated
developer, there are so much more technologies to explore!\

**Selenium Conference 2016**

<div>

\
Ugh! I always feel so far behind\... [Selenium Conf
2016](http://2016.seleniumconf.in/) happened in Bangalore, India back in
6/24/2016 to 6/26/2016, a whole four days ago, and I still haven\'t had
any time to check out their schedule\...\
\
I love that they turn their schedule posted on the web as a way to
archive the presenters videos and
slides. <https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/schedule>\
\
What I am excited about is:\
\

-   [Selenium Grid
    Workshop](https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2307/grid-workshop)
-   [Testing as a Container : Using Docker with selenium and friends to
    ship
    fast](https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2380/testing-as-a-container-using-docker-with-selenium-and-friends-to-ship-fast)
-   [Cross-platform, Multi-device Instant Communication Testing in
    Parallel using Appium and
    Docker](https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2519/cross-platform-multi-device-instant-communication-testing-in-parallel-using-appium-and-docker)

\
This is exactly what I was looking for!\
\
\... I wonder if over the Fourth of July Weekend I can fit in a spare
day to watch these videos, take notes, and turn them into new blog
entries?\
\
As always, Happy Testing!\
