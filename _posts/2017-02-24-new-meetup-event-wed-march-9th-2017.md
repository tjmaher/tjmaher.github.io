**6:30 pm onward**: The 99 Second Testing Talks Begin!\

-   The first five people giving a talk can line up at the front of the
    room. 
-   T.J. Maher will have a clipboard, where he can collect the name of
    speakers, the name of the talk, and any information participants
    want to exchange with the group (their website, Twitter handle,
    LinkedIn profile name, etc). 
-   One by one, going through the first set of speakers, after being
    introduced, let's cheer the them on as they launch into their talk. 
-   When the stopwatch app on my iPhone reaches 80 seconds, I'll signal
    the speaker that time is almost up. 
-   After 99 seconds, the person's talk ends. We applaud wildly! 
-   We go to the next person in line, and that person gets introduced. 
-   Has everyone spoken? The next five speakers who want to can come up,
    and the process continues. 
-   Anyone else want to give another 99 second talk? Come on up! 
-   Inspired by another talk you hear? Improvise a talk on the spot!

Origin of 99 Second Talks:
--------------------------

From Scott Berkin's Blog post, "[99 Second
Presentations](http://scottberkun.com/2012/99-second-presentations/)",
Nov 18, 2012:\
*"A running joke in the world of presentations is: how short can they
be? They used to be an hour. Then [TED went to 20
minutes](http://www.labnol.org/tech/ted-talk-18-minutes/12755/), [Pecha
Kucha to 6](http://www.pecha-kucha.org/), and [Ignite to
5](http://www.igniteseattle.com/). The [trend of short presentations has
been on the rise for
years](http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/14/presentations-pecha-kucha-technology-breakthroughs-oreilly.html)
and one wonders where it will stop.\
\
\"But then consider TV advertisements: they're 30 seconds long. The good
ones communicate many ideas well in a very short amount of time.\
\
"Years ago I ran an event at Microsoft called Design Day. Each year we'd
experiment with different formats and one year we tried 99 second
presentations. It went well and we did it the next year too. Unlike most
speaking events it gives the audience a real chance to participate.\
\
" \[\...\] It's a small commitment to get someone to speak for less than
2 minutes. They can practice their material 10 times in half an hour.
The surprise of short format speaking is it forces speakers to get to
the good stuff". *
