Have you ever needed to set up a brand-new project but were not sure where to start? I am like that right now!<br /><br />For the past week, I have been trying to figure out how I wanted to set up the file and folder structure for a new <b>Geb</b>&nbsp;+ <b>Groovy</b>&nbsp;+ <b>Gradle</b>&nbsp;+ <b>Spock</b> project. I was going to go back to Dave Haeffner's test site, The-Internet (&nbsp;<a href="https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login" target="_blank">link</a>&nbsp;) and take a look at writing a test for his login page:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.gebish.org/manual/current/" target="_blank">Geb</a> (pronounced "jeb") is a mash-up of <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, Selenium <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/" target="_blank">WebDriver</a>, with the Page Object Model, <a href="http://www.gebish.org/manual/current/api/geb/report/Reporter.html" target="_blank">Reporting</a>, and taking Snapshots built in.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a> is a scripting language language that I <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/search/label/Groovy" target="_blank">covered before in my blog</a>, specifically when talking about using Gradle for build.gradle configurations.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://gradle.org/" target="_blank">Gradle</a> does a lot more than handle installing third-party dependencies such as <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/" target="_blank">Chromedriver</a> when you want to spin up a new Chrome browser on your local machine. With Gradle, you can set up tests to be kicked off on the command line, just waiting to be fed into a continuous integration environment such as <a href="https://jenkins.io/" target="_blank">Jenkins</a>. &nbsp;</li><li>The <a href="http://spockframework.org/" target="_blank">Spock Framework</a> follows a Given / Then / When / Expect framework found in <a href="https://cucumber.io/" target="_blank">Cucumber</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin" target="_blank">Gherkin language</a> format that is usually paired with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>But how do I set all these tools up if I want to test ? How to get them all to work together?</div><br />Should I just repurpose Sauce Labs Test Framework, <b>Groovy-Geb-Spock-Selenium</b> at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/saucelabs-sample-test-frameworks/Groovy-Geb-Spock-Selenium" target="_blank">https://github.com/saucelabs-sample-test-frameworks/Groovy-Geb-Spock-Selenium</a>?<br /><br />A new co-worker of mine referred me to a tool he had heard of at a previous job that may help: <b>Yeoman.io</b>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BrWQMYL4COI/WAW0v9CcvkI/AAAAAAAALgQ/V11cKn9uh08zCB9T_RkMNm-Cxk7wdUGjgCLcB/s1600/yeoman.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BrWQMYL4COI/WAW0v9CcvkI/AAAAAAAALgQ/V11cKn9uh08zCB9T_RkMNm-Cxk7wdUGjgCLcB/s200/yeoman.png" width="200" /></a></div><br /><br /><ul><li><b>Official Site of Yeoman</b>:&nbsp;<a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">http://yeoman.io/</a></li><li><b>GitHub Site</b>:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/yeoman" target="_blank">https://github.com/yeoman</a></li><li><b>Official tutorial</b>: a Codelab:&nbsp;<a href="http://yeoman.io/codelab/index.html" target="_blank">http://yeoman.io/codelab/index.html</a></li></ul><br />In the next blog article, we will be borrowing heavily from "<a href="http://yeoman.io/codelab/index.html" target="_blank">Let's Scaffold a Web App</a>" written by Mehdy Dara ( Github:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/zckrs" target="_blank">zckers</a>&nbsp;) to walk through setting up your Mac or PC for Yeoman. We will also walk through installing a <b>Geb Generator</b>&nbsp;for Yeoman&nbsp;created by Chris Hluchan (&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hluchan-3a473413" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;), a Software Engineer at Google, formerly at Oracle. This will set up the project's&nbsp;<b>scaffolding</b>.<br /><br />Later articles will talk about about:<br /><br /><ul><li>Diving into the scaffolding code that has been generated, figuring out how it works</li><li>How to set up the Gradle configuration file to be able to run tests in parallel</li><li>Customizing the scaffolding to work with a login page</li><li>How Geb works with Selenium WebDriver: entering text, clicking buttons, and capturing web elements in page objects.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>This blog article will talk a bit about the history of the Yeoman tool.&nbsp;</div><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><h2>What is Scaffolding?</h2><br />According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffold_(programming)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:<br /><blockquote><i><b>"Scaffolding</b>&nbsp;is a technique supported by some&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" title="Model–view–controller">model–view–controller</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework" title="Software framework">frameworks</a>, in which the programmer can specify how the application database may be used. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">compiler</a>&nbsp;or framework uses this specification, together with pre-defined code templates, to generate the final code that the application can use to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" title="Create, read, update and delete">create, read, update and delete</a>&nbsp;database entries, effectively treating the templates as a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding" title="Scaffolding">scaffold</a>' on which to build a more powerful application.<br /><br />"Scaffolding is an evolution of database code generators from earlier development environments, such as Oracle's CASE Generator, and many other&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language" title="Fourth-generation programming language">4GL</a>&nbsp;client-server software development products.  <br /><br />"Scaffolding was made popular by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a>&nbsp;framework. It has been adapted to other software frameworks"&nbsp; </i></blockquote>According to <a href="http://yeoman.io/codelab/scaffold-app.html" target="_blank">Yeoman.io</a>,&nbsp;"Scaffolding, in the Yeoman sense of the word, means <b>generating files for your web app based on your specific configuration requests</b>. In this step, you'll see how Yeoman can generate files specifically for your favorite library or framework — with options for using other external libraries like <a href="https://webpack.github.io/" target="_blank">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank">Babel</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a> — with minimal effort". - <i>Yeoman's <a href="http://yeoman.io/codelab/scaffold-app.html" target="_blank">Codelab for the Scaffold-app</a></i>.<br /><br /><br /><h2>About Yeoman and other Build Tools</h2><br /><b>Yeoman.io</b> is an open-source project sponsored by the <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-at-Google-in-their-Developer-Relations-team" target="_blank">Google Chrome Developer Relations</a> team, such as Addy Osmani ( <a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a> ), Paul Irish ( <a href="https://www.paulirish.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> ). Can't find a way to generate the exact combination you need to scaffold your software project, or web application? You can use their toolset to write your own!&nbsp;Yeoman has <a href="http://www.npm-stats.com/~packages/yo" target="_blank">1.3 million</a> total installs and <a href="http://yeoman.io/generators/" target="_blank">1635</a> community generators.<br /><br />Yeoman was first rolled out at Google I/O 2012.<br /><br />Google I/O, <b>Better Web App Development Through Tooling</b><br />Paul Irish, June 28, 2012<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mk-tFn2Ix6g" width="560"></iframe> <i>48 minutes</i><br /><br />"Building a solid webapp is a challenge for all developers, but a plethora of tools have emerged recently to assist you. From starting boilerplates, to performance tuning and build tools, you'll get a full overview of the tooling ecosystem. In this session, you'll learn which mature and valuable open source projects can save you time as well as get answers to common questions in building a webapp". <br /><br />...
