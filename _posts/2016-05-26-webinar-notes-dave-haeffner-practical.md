\
\... The only problem I found with Dave\'s [Elemental
Selenium](http://www.elementalselenium/) newsletter: Too much Ruby and
not enough Java.\
\
We use Selenium WebDriver 2 with Java for our automated browser tests at
work. I can\'t just ~~rip off~~ or ~~steal~~ or ~~copy~~ or ~~borrow~~
or repurpose his code without much modification like I do on
[StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/).\
\
Hrm\... I discovered like almost everything else worthwhile, code
examples for [Dave\'s Elemental Selenium tips are on
GitHub](https://github.com/tourdedave/elemental-selenium-tips)!\
\
It would be good practice for me to go over his code repository, find a
chapter lesson that only lists only a Ruby example, and rewrite an
example in Java.\
\
This should be fun! Other than my fun little \"[weekend
work](https://github.com/tjmaher?tab=repositories)\" projects, I
haven\'t made updates to anything besides Fitbit-Boston\'s test
automation framework.\
\
This should be fun! I think I found my next fun weekend work project!\
\
Happy Testing!\
