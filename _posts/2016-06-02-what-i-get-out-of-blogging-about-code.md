On my lunchbreak, I was trying to explain to my co-workers what I get
out of blogging about code I am writing at work. 

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

You know the expression, if you really want to see if you know
something, try describing it to someone else? 

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

That\'s why I blog. 

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

Software development is brand new to me. It was scary when I first
started. I was completely out of my comfort zone. But it got better. 

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

What I am learn at work has been a good foundation. There, I learn about
the *what*, and the *how*.

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

It isn\'t until I start organizing my thoughts, creating a blog post, do
I figure out the *why*.

</div>

<div>

-   How did the software development process I am using take hold? Who
    first blogged about the concepts I am using? Was it [Kent
    Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck)? [Martin
    Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/)? [Simon
    Stewart](http://blog.rocketpoweredjetpants.com/)? [Jim
    Evans](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/)? [Uncle
    Bob](http://butunclebob.com/)? 
-   Who made the toolset I am using? When did it become adopted? Is it
    industry standard?
-   Although I may not understand it, where on GitHub is the open-source
    code? Can I understand how their project is constructed? Are there
    unit test formats I can borrow for my automation development? 

<div>

Through blogging, for me, comes *understanding*. 

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

And that\'s my thought of the day!

Happy Testing!\
