\-\-- Nobody likes job searching. Nobody.\
\
It is a stressful time for candidates for QA positions. You might be on
edge because time and money are running out. You might feel like you are
being placed through the wringer, being under constant examination. You
might feel cynical about the process, thinking that you are being
treated like nothing more than a big fat commission by the endless
swarms of recruiters cold calling you, and you might be easily
aggravated with them, and you might want to verbally lash out at them,
or give them a hard time.\
\
In a word: Don\'t. Please don\'t. Job searching is stressful all around,
not just for you, but for the recruiter who is attempting to place you
at their client company. Be kind to them. Always, always try to be
kind.\
\
On Monday, I started sending out a new survey \-- the first one I\'ve
ever created \-- **How Boston Recruiters See The Software Testing
Industry 2017**. I\'ve wanted to create a series of blog posts,
articles, and presentations on the perspective of a Boston area
recruiter \-- a viewpoint that would be quite helpful to members of the
new [Ministry of Testing -
Boston](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston) I just
started to help organize \-- for a while. I received a response back
immediately that really opened up my eyes to the harshness of their
reality.\
\

-   *Are you a Boston recruiter who places QA people? We\'d love to
    [hear what you think](https://goo.gl/forms/WQAAMkNZT1DdCEXk2)! *
-   *Respondents will be able to list their recruiting company [on the
    Ministry of Testing - Boston
    site](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/pages/22471005/Boston_Recruiters/).*

\
I received a response back immediately from \"Anonymous Recruiter\".
Clearly, AR was not having a good day. Even though AR has been a
recruiter for a bit over a year he has *wonderful* advice for manual
testers who are attempting to break into the automation field.\
\

So, What Is It Like Being A Recruiter?
--------------------------------------

**\
What Do You Love About Your Job?**\

<div>

**\
**\"Coming across someone that doesn\'t hate talking to me. It\'s
refreshing to come across people the enjoy talking about they do and it
provides a wonderful learning experience. Finding someone a position
that they are genuinely excited about. To know that one more person is
going to be happy going to work everyday is very rewarding\".\
\
**What is a typical day for you?**\
*\
*

</div>

<div>

\"Trying to ignore the fact that most people treat you like the piece of
\[crap\] they accidentally stepped in\".\

<div>

**\
What do you hate about your job?**\
**\
**

</div>

<div>

\"All of the lying. The client lies to you. Your sales people lie to
you. Your managers lie. The candidates lie. It\'s more degrading than
working clothing retail and watching someone destroying your table of
freshly folded sweaters\".\

* *About Manual Testing 
------------------------

<div>

\

</div>

*In spite of getting it from all sides, AR really gave a lot of good
advice for manual testers attempting to cope in today\'s ever changing
software testing market.*\
\
**How difficult is it for manual testers to find work?**\
**\
**

</div>

<div>

\"It\'s a saturated market. I can do on any job board, at any time, and
find twenty qualified QA people within ten miles of the company\".\
**\
Do you have any advice for manual testers who do not wish to learn how
to code and still remain employable? Is there a niche they should
specialize in?**

</div>

<div>

\
\"Honestly, in business, it\'s evolve or die. Regardless of the industry
you work in, you should always be learning. If you\'re not willing to
learn you, will reach a point in your career companies will ask why you
never took that next step. This is something you see a lot with older
Manual QA and Support people. Low-level programming roles are the new
blue collar jobs. Be multiple. Focus on evolving your skills all the
time. Try to see where there could be a growth opportunity. You\'re
already behind the curve, develop a plan that will put you ahead of it
in x number of years\".\
\
**What advice would you give a manual tester who wants to switch to an
automation development role?**\
**\
**

</div>

<div>

\"Go blended first. A hard switch will be difficult to make. Look for
roles that will allow you to learn on the job. If no such roles exist at
the time, start learning on your own. Then, make a portfolio website to
demonstrate your skills. I often talk with a high-level Java
Automation/QA that has done exactly this. He is one of my favorite
people to talk with. His enthusiasm for his work is infectious and he is
always pushing himself to be better, as we all should do\".\
**\
A manual tester wants to get into automation development. Do you think
they would need to earn a Computer Science Degree in order to make the
switch?**\
\
\"Yes/No. There is nothing more overrated to me than degrees and certs.
That being said they do help your marketability and earning potential.
If you\'re talented, you will shine through\".\
\

</div>

<div>

**Intense coding bootcamps have popped up all around Boston. Do clients
seem to be impressed when they see that on a resume?**\
\
\"It all comes down to your portfolio. Nothing makes me pass harder on
say, a UI/UX designer, than a personal website that looks like it is
from the Netscape era\".

</div>

<div>

\
**Oracle\'s Java Certification for an automation developer role: Worth
the time and effort or no?**\
\
\"I have yet to see it one job req and I\'ve worked a lot of them in the
past year. I feel like older companies focus more on certifications than
the younger ones\".

</div>

<div>

\
**If you were to order the following programming languages from most
in-demand by your clients to least in-demand, how would you order them?
Java, JavaScript, Objective C, Python, Ruby, Swift, other**

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

\"Regarding automation: Java, Python, C\#, JavaScript/Angular\"

</div>

<div>

**\
What are the hottest, most in-demand automation tools and technology
your clients are looking for this year?**\
\
\"Selenium, Jmeter, TestNG, TestComplete\"

</div>

<div>

\
**What automation testing tools are now passe?**\
**\
**\"Some clients have no interest in people that use Selenium alone\".\

<div>

\
\... Thank you so much, AR for all your advice!\
\
Happy Testing!\
