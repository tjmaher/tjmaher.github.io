\-\-- Did you know? [The Ministry of Testing -
Boston](http://bit.ly/mot_boston) has a group discount code for Agile
Testing Days! Want to borrow it? I checked with Techwell, and they said
it was okay to share! Use the discount code **ATDTJ** to get 20% off the
already discounted \"super early lobster\" pricing which is running
until April 27th, 2018.

Wow. It\'s like [my Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/tjmaher1) come to
life!\
\
\... I wonder how many people I can get recruit to come to a Ministry of
Testing - Boston? So far, we already have had:\

-   Angie Jones speak to our group in a Google Hangout last Spring.
-   Claire Moss, organizer of the Ministry of Testing - Atlanta brought
    Llewllyn Falco, to run a Lean Coffee last year.
-   When MoT-Boston invaded last year\'s TestBash Philly, we heard Ash
    Coleman, and Paul Holland speak.
-   Andreas Grabner will be speaking to us in April.
-   I\'ve been trying to recruit Lisa Crispin since last summer to give
    a quick Q & A in a webinar to us, but we\'ve haven\'t been able to
    do it yet.

\
This should be fun! If the baby doesn\'t come early, I think I should be
there!\
