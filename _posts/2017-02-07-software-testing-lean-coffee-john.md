\-\-- Tonight, I organized my very first [Ministry of Testing -
Boston](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/) event, a
\"Lean Coffee\".\
\
Picture a dinner-and-discussion event run like an Agile end-of-sprint
retrospective, where members write down on Post-It Notes things they
want to discuss, and people vote on the topics.\

I haven\'t run an event in at least five years, since I was part of the
Nerd Fun - Boston Meetup running five events a week, back in 2008 -
2011. Back then, my favorite place to meet was at John Harvard\'s Brew
House, holding discussions at a large round table that seats fifteen. It
is situated under a stairwell, and with the lower ceiling, the acoustics
are much better than you would think in the crowded pub atmosphere.\
\
I met up people before the event around the corner in the food court of
the Harvard Square Garage mall, with my \"Hello My Name is T.J.\"
nametag, and a big red MEETUP sign attached to my black messenger bag,
just like the old days.\

\
\
We filed in at 6:30 pm, and had a lively discussion! Some of the
discussion topics:\

-   Scrum as a QA Process
-   How Can We Tell If Automation is Improving Quality
-   Favorite Automation Tool for Agile
-   Cucumber vs TestNG vs JUnit
-   Should QA be in DEV teams?
-   Picking Stable Jobs/ Compaines
-   Suggestions for Agile Training
-   \"Testing\" or \"QA\"
-   Lean Coffee at Work

It was a good break for me. I have been doing nothing but try to set up
interviews for the past few days, trying to find my next automation
development gig.\
\
If you want to keep track of the discussion, I have posted a
conversation thread on the Ministry of Testing - Boston Message Board
at <https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/messages/boards/thread/50584497/>\
\
Happy Testing!\
