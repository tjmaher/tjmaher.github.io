\
\... So that\'s what STAR stands for: *Software Testing Analysis &
Review*. I had been wondering about that. I wonder if they are
affiliated with the [EuroSTAR Software Testing
Conferences](https://eurostarsoftwaretesting.com/) coming up in October
2016?\

David Dang \| *Zenergy Technologies*\
*\
\"After the first wave of open source test automation tools like
Fitnesse and Watir, we are now in a stronger, second wave led by
Selenium-based frameworks. This powerful swell, fueled by a major shift
toward web-based applications on desktops and mobile devices, is
changing how corporations tackle software test automation. Add in a
desire to replace old-guard, commercial tools in favor of newer
technology with lower costs, we may have a perfect storm. However, with
different technologies come new challenges\....\"* [Learn

*\"If it were easy to produce high-quality mobile apps, everyone would
be doing it. But mobile development is tough. Consumers expect constant
enhancements and a great experience on an ever-growing variety of
devices. Many mobile app development teams are turning to agile to meet
the time-to-market and quality demands of their customers. But these
same teams often focus on changing the development (coding) process, and
neglect the testing. In this session, we'll discuss and show real
examples of how to best carry out the major phases of testing within the

*\"Once upon a time, Dawn Haynes was a software tester. Now she's most
often found in the classroom, helping others tackle the same day-to-day
challenges that she has encountered on projects for the past thirty
years. Dawn now recognizes that, although she had great instincts about
testing that initially made her incredibly clever and effective at
breaking software, it's been the subtle questions, mantras, and foibles
she's encountered throughout her career that demonstrate how wrong some
of her testing ideas have been. Now, Dawn reflects on how committed she
was to those fledgling assertions\...\"* [Learn
