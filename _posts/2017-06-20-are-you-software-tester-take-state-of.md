\-\-- Tonight was wonderful! The [Ministry of Testing -
Boston](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/) gathered
together in Assembly Square, Somerville, MA at the headquarters of
[SmartBear,](http://www.smartbear.com/) maker of automated testing
toolsets such as
 [SoapUI](https://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/soapui-ng/overview/),
[SwaggerHub](https://swaggerhub.com/), and
[TestComplete](https://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/overview/).\
\
SmartBear walked us through their entire testing process\... They gave
us so much information, it was difficult to take notes!\
\
You can watch the program yourself
