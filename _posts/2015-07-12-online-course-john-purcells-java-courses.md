\-\-- To help me up-to-speed with Java programming after a ten year
absence of writing any type of code, I have been working since January
through many helpful courses I have found online. A few that I have
liked:\
\

-   Alan Richardson\'s [Selenium 2 WebDriver Basics with
    Java](http://courses.compendiumdev.co.uk/courses/selenium-2-webdriver-with-java) 
-   MIT\'s Introduction to Computer Science and [Programming Using
    Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-0) 

\
Another favorite of mine is John Purcell\'s \"[Cave of
Programming](http://www.caveofprogramming.com/)\". John started out on
Udemy.com, but has branched out to his own site. Every time he comes up
with the next level of a course, he marks the earlier levels down until
over time they become free.\

Here is a list of a few of his free courses:\
\
**Java for the Complete Beginner**:
<http://courses.caveofprogramming.com/courses/java-for-complete-beginners>\
\

-   Covers: if, for, while loops, switches, arrays, classes, objects,
    methods, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, interfaces, using
    generics, handling exceptions, enums types. It even covers the Java
    Collections Framework with ArrayList, LinkedList, Hashmap, Queues,
    etc. 

\
**Multi-threaded Java**:
<http://courses.caveofprogramming.com/courses/java-multithreading>\
\

-   Covers starting threads, basic thread synchronization, and talks
    about deadlocks, and semaphores. 

\
**Java Design Patterns and Architecture**:\
<http://courses.caveofprogramming.com/courses/java-design-patterns-and-architecture>\
\

-   Popularized by the \"Gang Of Four\", it covers various software
    design patterns. Writing automated tests with Selenium, I find I am
    using the Singleton Pattern,  

\
\
**What\'s new in Java 8**: *Under
Construction: *<http://courses.caveofprogramming.com/courses/java8>\
\

-   This course just started being designed, and only covers lambdas as
    of yet.
