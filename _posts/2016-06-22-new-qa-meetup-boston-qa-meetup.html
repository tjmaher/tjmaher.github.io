If you are a software tester in the Boston area, check out a new technology Meetup group, <b>The Boston QA Meetup</b> at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boston-QA-Meetup">http://www.meetup.com/Boston-QA-Meetup</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Next <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Boston?src=hash">#Boston</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/QA?src=hash">#QA</a> meetup at <a href="https://twitter.com/fitbit">@Fitbit</a>, Tuesday, June 21 at 6pm! <a href="https://t.co/LxWpqeyb14">https://t.co/LxWpqeyb14</a></div>â€” Conrad Hollomon (@hollomancer) <a href="https://twitter.com/hollomancer/status/742822700863885314">June 14, 2016</a></blockquote><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> Meetup.com is a wonderful resource! I met most of my friends through Nerd Fun Boston, where I was an event coordinator for a good three years, running five events a week back in 2008 - 2010, gathering groups of geeks to bounce around Boston, going to lectures historical, technological, and scientific all around Harvard University, Harvard Medical, the Museum of Science, and MIT.<br /><br />When I became an automation developer a year-and-a-half ago, I sought out many different <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/search/label/Meetup" target="_blank">software development Meetup groups</a>, some security testing Meetups, but no QA Meetups.<br /><br />Fitbit-Boston has been hosting a lot of Meetups at its new space ever it moved into its large office last August... the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Boston/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a> Meetup meets there regularly. Today, this new group, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boston-QA-Meetup" target="_blank">The Boston QA Meetup</a> which formed last October, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boston-QA-Meetup/events/231893839/" target="_blank">met there</a>.<br /><br />It was fun! James Moore, the man who founded the Boston automation department two-and-a-half years ago gave a fun and entertaining talk about how we handle automated testing at work. And the main organizer of The Boston QA Meetup, Conrad Hollomon, QA Engineer also presented.<br /><br />Conrad's talk, "A Brief History of Software Quality, Pt. 1", was amazing! In this first part the focus was on Quality, and how is was measured, touching on Egyptians building the pyramids, quality in the Hammurabi Code, and mostly focused on how design principles, and a focus on quality saved the Japanese automobile industry.<br /><br />Can't wait until Part II!<br /><br />Until then, Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
