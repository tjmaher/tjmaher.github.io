A Selenium WebDriver test can be slow. Imagine running a test for a login screen:<br /><br />... <i>waiting, waiting, waiting</i>... Surprise, <b>it's a browser!</b> ... <i>waiting, waiting, waiting</i>... It's a login screen! ... <i>waiting for SendKeys to enter the username and password into the proper textboxes</i>... <i>and for the Login button to be clicked</i>.<br /><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />Now, let's examine a few tests you can perform on a Login screen:<br /><ul><li>Enter a valid email address as a username with a correct password, and you are taken to the basic landing page.&nbsp;</li><li>Enter a username missing an '@' or a "." and an alert message appears: "Usernames must be an email address"&nbsp;</li><li>Use the email address of someone not registered as a user: "Either the email address or password is invalid. Please try again".&nbsp;</li><li>Use a valid email but an invalid password: "Either the email address or password is invalid. Please try again".&nbsp;</li></ul><div>That first bullet point might make a good Selenium WebDriver test.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The second bullet point might make a good test.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Every other bullet pointed test might be better suited as a test of the <i>webservices</i> underlying the Login page, i.e. the place you feed the username and password data to, for processing.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>With the first test, we are checking that we can enter data using the browser as a user interface. We are checking that we can feed data<i> </i><b>to the webservice</b>.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the second test, we are checking that we can get the response from the webservice, and output it <b>to the browser</b>. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The third and fourth test is essentially a duplication of the second test, checking that:</div><div><ul><li>browser input -&gt; data is fed into webservice -&gt; webservice has output -&gt; output to browser's alert message.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Over the past few months, I have experimented with testing at the API Level:<br /><br /><ul><li>Using <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/coming-up-how-to-work-with-rest-apis.html" target="_blank">Apache HTTP Components</a></li><li>Using <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/07/introduction-to-api-testing-with.html" target="_blank">Postman</a></li></ul><div>... Maybe I need to look into <a href="http://swagger.io/" target="_blank">Swagger.io</a>?&nbsp;</div></div></div><div><br /></div><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
