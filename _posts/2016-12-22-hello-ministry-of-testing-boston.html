It looks like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/" target="_blank">Greater Boston QA and Testing Meetup</a>, a software testing group I spoke at a few months ago about <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/11/video-10172016-how-to-pass-coding.html" target="_blank">How to Pass a Coding Interview as an Automation Developer</a>, has been rebranded!<br /><br />Conrad Holloman &lt; <a href="https://twitter.com/hollomancer" target="_blank">@hollomancer</a> &gt;, founder of the group, sent our this email yesterday:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Hi, I'm very happy to announce that the Boston QA Meetup is joining Ministry of Testing (<a href="http://www.ministryoftesting.com/" target="_blank">http://www.ministryoftesting.com</a>) as a sub-chapter!<br /><br />The Ministry of Testing aims to change and lead within the software testing world. They are doing this through a strong focus on learning, collaboration and resources. You are part of the story too, and we hope you can join us along the way!<br />As part of this change:<br /><br />We are looking at opportunities to host longer-form QA and testing events, and possibly something focused on the New England region!<br /><br />We will be merging our Slack chat with the global Ministry of Testing community!<br /><br />Additionally, we are still looking for hosts and speakers for the first quarter of 2017. Contact me if interested!<br /><br />-Conrad</i></blockquote>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/" target="_blank">https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/</a> and sign up!<br /><br />I love the Ministry of Testing! I've been enjoying their <a href="http://www.ministryoftesting.com/testing-feeds/" target="_blank">testing feeds</a>&nbsp;for years, and I blog irregularly for their Software Testing Club subgroup, at <a href="http://www.softwaretestingclub.com/profile/TJMaher" target="_blank">http://www.softwaretestingclub.com/profile/TJMaher</a>Â­<br /><br />Hrm... I wonder if that means that TestBash - Boston might be coming to Massachusetts? I wonder if they need any help organizing? <br /><i><br /></i><br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
