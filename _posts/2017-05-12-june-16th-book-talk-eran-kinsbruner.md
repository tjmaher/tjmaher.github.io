### About the The Digital Quality Handbook:

<div>

A[ccording to Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0692885994/):\
\"As mobile and web technologies continue to expand and basically drives
large organizational business in virtually every vertical or industry,
it is critical to understand how to take existing release practices for
mobile and web apps to the next level, including software development
life cycle (SDLC), tools, quality, etc. Organizations which are already
enjoying the power of digital are still struggling with various
challenges that can be related to many factors, such as:\
[]{#more}\
• \"SDLC and processes maturity\
\
• \"Expanding test coverage to include more non-functional testing, user
condition testing, etc.\
\
• \"Coping with existing limitations of open source tools and
frameworks\
\
• \"Sustaining correctly sized and up-to-date mobile test labs\
\
• \"Getting proper quality insights upon each test cycle prior and post
production\
\
• \"Branching wisely cross-platform and cross-feature test suites\
\
\"The issues above are just a few out of probably many others existing
today. However, this book tackles those and provide working best
practices to overcome them. Each chapter in this book addresses a key
challenge and provides practical examples and real life \'recipes\' to
overcome the difficulties and eventually help other organizations who
might be facing the same difficulties\".\
