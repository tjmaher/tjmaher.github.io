\... I do prefer my original title, which referred to the changing
definition of quality as you moved from being a manual tester to an
automation developer.\
\
I can\'t believe it was a year ago that [Rob
Mitchell](https://techbeacon.com/contributors/robert-mitchell), Managing
Editor of TechBeacon gave me a call February of 2016 after I inquired
about writing for HPE\'s online magazine\... but I had never written
professionally before. What the heck do I write about?\

Instead of an outline, I submitted something written for this blog back
in April 2015, [How to Switch Careers in the Software
Industry](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/04/how-to-switch-careers-in-software.html).\
\
Rob broke down what I had submitted into an outline showing the
essential elements, and after working on what we had come up with, he
submitted the outline as a proposal to the review board. After being
accepted, Rob assigned me to [Mitch
Pronschinske](https://techbeacon.com/contributors/mitch-pronschinske) as
my editor. Mitch is amazing! He really helped me through all my
insecurities about being a new writer. He always took the time to answer
all my many questions, no matter how silly.\
\
After a couple of weeks, I came up with \"[Switching careers in QA: From
manual testing to automation
development](https://techbeacon.com/switching-careers-qa-manual-testing-automation-development)\".
Since it was published April 7, 2016, it has had 9,036 pageviews, and
has been shared through the sharing sidebar 294 times.\
\
Thank you very much, Rob and Mitch for having the all the patience in
the world with me as a new writer!\
