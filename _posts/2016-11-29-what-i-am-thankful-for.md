years ago, I thought I was doing quite well, career-wise, not realizing
just how precarious my situation really was at my job.\
\
Within four years, I had worked my way up at this past company to acting
as a QA Lead, supervising an offshore team of manual testers manually
testing mobile applications. The week after a productive meeting with my
boss to see how I could work my way to being a QA Manager, this company
laid off all but a few manual testers, myself included, since I hadn\'t
coded since grad school, ten years before.\
\
Since then, it\'s been a mad scramble. A desperate three month job
search where I spent a good fifty to sixty hours a week either studying
automation development, or prepping for automation development
interviews. My research notes became this blog.\
\
When I finally found a company willing to take me on and train me in
automation based on my coding portfolio I managed to assemble, I still
spent a good fifty to sixty hours a week studying Selenium WebDriver +
Java automation development.\
\
Then it was another desperate three month job search when my two years
of automation experience didn\'t live up to the vision of a new manager.
It was tough, but I survived.\
\
I\'ve now been at my new job, working with my nose to the grindstone for
the past two months, working with REST Assured to test RESTful APIs,
Nightwatch.js for our Node.js projects, and trying to teach myself Geb +
Groovy + Spock for future Groovy projects, trying not to get swept away
by the current like so many of my manual QA co-workers.\
\
Somehow, I managed in just two years, to go from being just a manual
tester, to an automation developer,  to a software developer in test.
But that is not what I am thankful for\...\
\
What I am thankful for, this Thanksgiving season, is my brilliant wife,
who has supported me, stood by me, rooted for me, and coached me all
throughout this turmoil\... Thank you, sweetie!\
\
Happy Testing to all, and to all a Good Night!\
