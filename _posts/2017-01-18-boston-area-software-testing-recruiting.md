\-\-- Are You a Recruiting Company or Placement Firm in the Boston or
Cambridge, MA area? Are you having trouble finding software testing
candidates to meet the needs of your clients? Have you ever thought
about hosting a Meetup event at your place of business, educating
software testers on how to keep up with the ever changing software
industry and sharing your knowledge ?\
\
A newly rebranded Meetup group of software testers, **The Ministry of
Testing - Boston**, has just been formed, with the Greater Boston QA and
Testing Meetup moving under the umbrella of the **Ministry of Testing**,
a UK-based software testing community. We are looking to place new
events on our event calendar for our *almost four hundred person
strong* Meetup.\

Imagine an event where your recruiters could give the \"inside scoop\"
on how software testers adjust their skill set to meet the needs of
today\'s job market, navigating these uncertain times.\
\
Imagine establishing a relationship with thirty or so future candidates
for software testing positions as you answer difficult questions such
as:\
\

-   Is there hope for traditional manual tester without a coding
    background to get placed in a perm or contract position?
-   What tools and technologies does your company forecast to be in hot
    demand in 2017?
-   What is the best strategy for potential candidates to get themselves
    ready for automation development positions?
-   What do you look for in a resume?
-   How do you pitch candidates to clients who may not be an exact
    match?
-   Do coding bootcamps even help QA Engineers? If so, which ones? 
-   What are the difference qualifications needed between a mid-level QA
    Engineer, a Senior QA Engineer, and a Software Engineer in Test?
-   What qualifications does it take to be a QA Lead or a QA Manager?

\
This could be all addressed in one Meetup event or a series of Meetup
events.\
\
\... And, of course, members would be encouraged to bring their resume.\
\
Interested? Share your event idea, what you would like as a discussion
topic, and the location of the Meetup Event with [Conrad
Holloman](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/members/194532776/),
or [T.J.

\
Happy Testing!\
