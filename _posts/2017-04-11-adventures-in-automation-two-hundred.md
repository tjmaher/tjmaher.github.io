\-\-- Wow, this is the 200th post I have written here on Adventures in
Automation.\
\
This blog started a bit over two years ago. As I was trying to do one
last big push to try to (somehow) make the shift from manual to
automated testing, my wife suggested that instead of the many research
notes I was compiling stay on my computer, why not share them in a
blog?\
\
It was a fabulous suggestion! Not only did I have a code portfolio [on
GitHub](https://github.com/tjmaher) that employers could view, they also
received a walkthrough of the code with my blog from automating a simple
site [covering basic
concepts](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/06/simple-manipulation-of-login-page.html),
to building a test framework [for more complex
sites](http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/12/next-week-automating-amazon-how-i-am.html) and
testing [more complex
APIs](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/coming-up-how-to-work-with-rest-apis.html).\

\
It\'s still a mad scramble for me; I\'ve only been coding on-the-job for
the past two years.\
\
Right now, I am attempting to figure out how to assemble a mobile
testing framework with [Serenity
BDD](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/03/serenity-bdd-automation-framework-that.html)to
handle tests and reports, and
[Appium](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AdventuresInAutomation/~3/72yd8xG9wd4/learning-appium-what-is-appium-server.html)
to handle mobile automation.\
\
I have to say, thank you, dear reader, for all of your support over the
past two years.\
\
And, by the way \.... Happy Testing!\
