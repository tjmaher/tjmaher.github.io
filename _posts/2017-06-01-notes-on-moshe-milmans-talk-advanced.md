\
**About Applitools:**\
\
\"Applitools was founded by software developers on a mission to shorten
the release cycles of their product. Despite having good unit test
coverage and automated end-to-end functional tests, a full manual
regression of the UI, covering multiple operating systems, web browsers,
screen resolutions and localizations, took days to complete.\
\
\"Back at the time, there were plenty of excellent commercial and
open-source tools that allowed you to test the functionality of your app
through the UI, but there were no tools that allowed you to
automatically test the look & feel and user experience of your app. That
is, verifying that each UI element in each page appears in the right
color, shape, position and size, and that it does not overlap or hide
other UI elements.\
\
\"After years of hard work carried out by experts, we successfully built
a vast tech-stack that solved the automated visual testing problem\".

### About The Talk

\
Moshe Milman\'s talk was about \"**Advanced Test Automation Techniques
For Responsive Apps And Sites**\".\
\
What is responsive web design? Moshe showed us the Wikipidia Entry
at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design>\
\
*\"Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to [web
design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design) aimed at allowing
desktop webpages to be viewed in response to the size of the screen or
web browser one is viewing with. In addition it\'s important to
understand that Responsive Web Design tasks include offering the same
support to a variety of devices for a single website. As mentioned by
the Nielsen Norman Group: content, design and performance are necessary
across all devices to ensure usability and satisfaction\".*\
\
Responsive Web Design is aimed at crafting sites to provide optimal
viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices.\
\
Go to the Wikipedia page above. Make it full screen. Then make it the
size of an iPad. An iPhone. The look and feel of the page changes,
depending on the size of the screen.\
\
\... Well, it\'s not perfect. When the screen is as small as an iPhone
the images start overlapping the far left column, where the left menu
is.\
\
Compare that with Github.com: Full View\

  *All the web elements accounted for!*
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But if we start narrowing the screen\...\

  *Where did the Sign In and Sign Up button go?*
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sign In and Sign Up button start disappearing. In its place is the
\"Hamburger\" icon, the three lines stacked like two bun halves and a
hamburger patty, all the way in the far right corner.\
\
If we narrow the screen even more\...\
\

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  *The Screen! It readjusted!*
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\... All the page elements shifted!\
\
Why is this important? \... Now, instead of having to have four or five
different bodies of code, for each size web or mobile screen, if you
code it to be a Reactive Web and Mobile site the layout will
automatically adjust to be the perfect fit!\
\
Though, this does have problems when it comes to automation. What if the
automated test expects you to click \"Sign In\" or \"Sign Up\" in the
upper right hand corner, and oops! It is not visible. It\'s the
hamburger icon!\
\
Browser windows have properties. You can set the widths of the window
using \"window.innerwidth\" and \"window.innerlength\". If you, the
tester know that at width (1) there is a button and width (2) there is
the hamburger icon, you can in the Page Object handle both widths.\
\
Moshe\'s presentation was quite similar to the one he used a few years
ago at \#SeleniumCamo 2015.\

\
\
Moshe also ran a few demos of Applitools, demoing reports shown in the
above presentation.\
\
Here are a few pointers Moshe gave for writing automated tests:\
**[\
]{.underline}[Headless vs Non-Headless Browsers?]{.underline}**\
\

-   Moshe: Headless browsers such as PhantomJs or Headless versions of
    Chrome are good for basic sanity tests, since they run faster.
    Without the UI displaying or a waiting for a full version of a
    browser to spin up, it is a lot quicker. Need to check responsive
    web sites? Use a real browser, not a headless browser.

\
[*"Look and feel is always better with real
devices\".*]{style="font-size: x-large;"}\
**[\
]{.underline}[Emulators vs Actual Devices?]{.underline}**\
\

-   Moshe: Emulators are great for general tests, but for accepting
    tests, it is better to use real devices. Emulator screen size and
    performance doesn't always match actual devices. Not always the
    perfect result

\
**[Assert or Verify?]{.underline}**\
\
Let\'s say you have a five step procedure to place an order on an
eCommerce site, and you need to check, say, Order Number, Item Number,
Item Quantity, Sales Tax, etc, Moshe recommends NOT stopping the test
with an error. Let the entire test run, errors and all to get a
baseline. You can do this with the **softAssert** command (something we
used at Fitbit).\
\
Make sure though that if you are doing an extensive test, only do
it *once*. Don\'t duplicate tests.\
\
Thank you so much, Moshe for speaking with us at the Ministry of Testing
- Boston!\
\
\
Happy Testing!
