\-\-- I haven\'t had this much fun drafting this new slide deck since my
student job as a Graphic Artist / Desktop Publisher back at Bridgewater
State\'s Davis Alumni Center!\
\
Back then I loved helping organize events, plan promotional campaigns,
draft flyers, create T-Shirts and logos, plaster flyers I designed all
around campus, and volunteer to set up chairs and join the student
ushers.\
\
I never spoke at these events. I may have been a Computer Science Major
/ Theater Minor, but when I was on-stage, I was safely in the middle of
the chorus as a performer, or backstage where my crippling stage-fright
wouldn\'t kick in. I may have been able to goof around on stage in cute
community theater productions in elementary school and junior high, but
when I was in high-school competing for parts with budding
professionals, I knew where my true talents lie.\
\
Oddly enough, I am pretty comfortable giving end-of-sprint product
demos, no matter how many people are in the room. Let me have my
cue-cards so I can keep the talk tight and on-track, and I am fine. Oh,
I might need to spend a few years working through
[Toastmasters](https://www.meetup.com/Toastmasters-MIT/events/234456314/)
before I am anywhere near TED Talk standards.\
\
My slide deck should be finished in the next day or two. I have a rough
script for the 30 minute talk that I will go over twenty or thirty times
in the next week. I know the material, first living it and then
organizing the information to create the [article on which the talk is
based](http://techbeacon.com/how-pass-coding-interview-automation-developer).
I think I will do fine\...\
\
What do you think of the draft of the cover page and the title page?

\
\... This Speaker Page was for people who are reading along at home,
after the fact on **Slideshare**
at <http://www.slideshare.net/tjmaher1>.\
\
I was going to upload the slides to my Slideshare account before the
lecture.\
\

-   Mention to the audience when I reach this page that these slides are
    stored on Slideshare.net/tjmaher1. They can enjoy the lecture and
    don\'t need to take notes if they don\'t wish to. 

\
Hrm\... I think \"About the Speaker\" and \"About the Talk\" should go
on two separate pages. Thank you Gustavo Adolfo Rivera Yeomans!\
\
\
\
Thank you very much!\
\
Happy Testing!\
