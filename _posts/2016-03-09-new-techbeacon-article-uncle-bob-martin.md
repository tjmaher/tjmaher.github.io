\-\-- If you have ever wondered about the history of Agile Software
Development ( which I have [written
about](https://www.blogger.com/2015/01/agile-software-development.html%22)
in this
[blog](https://www.blogger.com/2015/02/shifts-in-software-testing.html)
) you should check out the new article published in TechBeacon, \"[Uncle
Bob Martin: The Agile Manifesto, 15 years
later](http://techbeacon.com/uncle-bob-martin-agile-manifesto-15-years-later)\",
written by Malcolm Issacs.\

> *\"Robert \'Uncle Bob\' Martin is one of the 17 software development
> visionaries who met at The Lodge at Snowbird ski resort in Utah in
> February 2001 to discuss the various lightweight development methods
> of the time. The result of that meeting would become known as the

Although I first heard about \"Uncle Bob\" back in grad school with
\"[Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and
Practices](http://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445/)\",
I\'ve only encountered his blog articles
([butUncleBob.com](http://butunclebob.com/)), [free lectures on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHnLmvDxGTY&list=PL0t9k9FlHnTki4D06nfKTfO9aw0xaEIwx),
and purchasable lectures on his [Clean Code](https://cleancoders.com/)
website only recently.\

\
\
It\'s funny\... even though I have been working in the software industry
since the pre-Agile days of 1996, as a manual tester there has been much
in the world of software development that I wasn\'t aware of.\
\
Even though I earned my Masters of Software Engineering from Brandeis
University back in 2008, we never touched upon the literary works of
Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, Robert Martin, or any of the Agile
founders.\
\
Only since I decided last summer that as an insecure newly minted
developer I had to give myself a crash course in software development
have I been encountering them:\

-   Martin Fowler\'s [Refactoring: Improving Design of Existing
    Code](http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672)
    *(1999)*.
-   Andy Hunt\'s [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to
    Master](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)
    *(1999)*
-   Robert C. Martin\'s [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software
    Craftmanship](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) *(2008)*

\
\
\... Maybe the insecurity will fade as I work towards my second year of
experience?\
\
\... Or maybe if I watch enough of Uncle Bob\'s videos, his software
design principles will sink into my brain?\
