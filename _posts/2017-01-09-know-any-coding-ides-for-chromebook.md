\-\-- Two weeks ago, the hard drive on my home computer started
clicking. That is when the blue screens happened. DTC\_WATCHDOG\_ERRORS
and stopcodes thrown in Windows 10. First once a day, then once an hour,
and this weekend, every time my Desktop loads up.\
\
While I am trying to figure out what PC to buy next (Dell XPS? Dell
Inspiron? All-in-one? Regular desktop? I surf the web, use IntelliJ, and
not much else on it), I was going to pick up a cheap Chromebook to
handle my daily requirement of blogging and web surfing at home, or
blogging about various Meetups I attend.\
\
Let\'s say I want to tinker with Java or JavaScript. Is there an IDE you
like to use? I was tinkering with blogging about REST Assured next, but
I didn\'t think doing any Java development, no matter how small the
project, would work on a Chromebook, but I wanted to check.\
\
Happy Testing!\
