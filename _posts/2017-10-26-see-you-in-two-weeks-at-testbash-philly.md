\-\-- Wow. I\'ll be attending my very first software testing conference
in just two weeks! I can\'t wait!\

    FringeArts 11/9/2017 & 11/10/2017

If you see me around, wave me down and introduce yourself! Ignore the
confused look on my face when you say hello, as I try to remember if I
should know you already, went to college with you, or worked with you.
And I apologize\... it\'s going to take me a few times to have your name
sink in.\
\
I\'ll be there with my little Chromebook, blogging away!\
\
See you there! I hear they still have 16 or so tickets available.\
\
Happy Testing!\
