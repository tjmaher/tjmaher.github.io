\-\-- Want a teaser of my upcoming
[AutomationGuild.com](http://automationguild.com/) talk?\
\
I will be speaking about \"How to Pass a Coding Interview as an
Automation Developer\", a more polished version of the [October 2016
talk](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/11/video-10172016-how-to-pass-coding.html)
I gave to the Ministry of Testing - Boston, based on my [TechBeacon
article](https://techbeacon.com/how-pass-coding-interview-automation-developer)
of the same name. I include:\
\

-   \"I\'m an automation developer, not a coder! Why am I being
    interviewed?\"
-   \"What does the interviewer expect of me?\"
-   \"How can I prepare?\"
-   I also walk through three different coding examples.

\
Producing the pre-recorded video was stressful\... but not as stressful
as a coding interview!\
\
I\'ll be giving a LIVE Q & A session to complement the talk on Tuesday,
January 9th, 2018!\
\

Happy Testing!\
