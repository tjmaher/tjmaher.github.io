\-\-- With all that\'s been going on lately, I missed a very important
anniversary\...\
\
As of last month, I have spent twenty years in the software testing
industry.\
\

How I Started: From a Computer Science Major to a QA Engineer
-------------------------------------------------------------

\
Unsure how I wanted to apply my Computer Science degree, I left college
for a bit during my Junior year at Bridgewater State. Businesses were
just starting to invade the web, causing the early pioneers of this new
electronic frontier to grumble.\
\
Demand was so high to find people to staff these new \"dot.coms\",
placement agencies were called in to weed through job applications and
find good candidates. I found myself at one of these agencies, Sally
Silver Contract Services. After testing my analytical skills and
reviewing my technical background, some code samples of work I was doing
in the classroom, and a rough portfolio from when I spent two years in a
college job as a graphic artist / desktop publisher, they asked me,
\"Have you ever heard of \'Quality Assurance\'? Oracle has a new
division in Massachusetts, a three month contract position with an
option for extension\...\"\

Back to School: Finishing BSCS, and Earning Masters of Software Engineering
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
That was my first assignment as a QA contract consultant, back in August
1996. I finished up my BSCS/ Theatre Minor in 1999. My Masters of
Software Engineering from Brandeis in 2008 helped me understand the
entire software development life cycle, where for one semester I could
be a database developer, and for another, a project manager.\
\
This technical skillset has served me well, even before I became an
automation developer, allowing me to develop good working relationships
with developers, project managers, and user experience designers, and
its helped me hit-the-ground-running with projects.\
\

Why I\'m Passionate About QA
----------------------------

\
I\'ve always loved QA! Networking with:\
\

-   Project managers to test the requirements
-   Developers to test the product
-   User experience people to see how we can make the product more
    intuitive
-   Marketers to make sure we are building a product that meets the
    customer\'s needs

<div>

\... My most important role as a QA Engineer is to be an end-user
advocate.

Changes in Software Testing
---------------------------

\

<div>

Right now we\'re seeing some interesting changes in software testing:\
\

-   Developers and System Administration and QA are being smooshed into
    \"DevOps\". 
-   Traditional QA manual testing roles are being rewritten, with the
    one-two punch of open-source automated testing tools and continuous
    integration, where QA teams are being ramped up to learn how to
    code.

\

Adapting To Change
------------------

\
I am also seeing interesting changes in my role in QA. I now seem to be
a published writer, working on my third Automation Development article
for [TechBeacon.com](http://techbeacon.com/) which should be published
in a few weeks.\
\
I\'ve switched from being a manual to an automated tester. Maybe in a
few years I can become a Software Developer in Test, or maybe a QA
Manager. I miss when I was acting as a QA Lead for an offshore team of
five manual mobile testers. That was fun! \... Whatever the future
brings, I am looking forward to it.

Here\'s to the next Twenty Years in Testing!\
