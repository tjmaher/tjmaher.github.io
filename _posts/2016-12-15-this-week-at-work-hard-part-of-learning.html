This week, at work, I've been attempting to compose a new end-to-end test using libraries that other coders at my workplace have written.<br /><br />It's a simple test: When you process a patient using Component A, and register them using Component B, in the database you should see status code C.<br /><br />A&nbsp;+ B = C.<br /><br />Lucky for me, another developer already wrote libraries of Nightwatch.Js tests for Component A and Component B. I am just making logical assumptions on what parts I need and glueing them together, hoping it all works out. Then, I'm using the PostgeSQL library that Node.js provides to get the status code C that I need.<br /><br />Sometimes, it doesn't all work out.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Hard part reading other's <a href="https://twitter.com/nightwatchjs">@NightwatchJs</a>: Which is vanilla <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaScript?src=hash">#JavaScript</a>? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ES6?src=hash">#ES6</a>? <a href="https://twitter.com/nodejs">@NodeJs</a>? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MochaJs?src=hash">#MochaJs</a>?

And more notes equals more blog entries!<br /><br />When I come up for air in January, after this month's deep dive, expect to see a lot more projects involving Nightwatch.js, an automated testing solution geared towards Node.js projects.<br /><br />Until then, Happy Testing! <br /><br />... Wow. I can't believe how happy I am at work, with my new position as a Software Engineer in Test. Great company! Great co-workers! And a really, really great job. Let's hope I can get up to speed quickly.<br /><br />-T.J.
