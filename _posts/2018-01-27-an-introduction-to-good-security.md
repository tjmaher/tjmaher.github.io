\-\-- I was nervous starting my position at a [cloud-based security
firm](http://threatstack.com/). It \'s been a while since I was a
security tester testing against the [OWASP Top
Ten](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project).
How would I get trained in good security practices? Luckily, newbies
like myself aren\'t just thrown into the deep end. They have **Sam
Bisbee ([\@sbisbee](https://twitter.com/sbisbee))**,  Chief Security
Officer of Threat Stack to guide them.\

What were the first introductory security sessions like? Take a look at
talk that Sam Bisbee gave at [AWS:
re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) on November 2017:\
\
\"[Stop Wasting Your Time: Focusing on Security Practices The Actually
Matter](https://youtu.be/d4XXmZi32tg)\".\

What is AWS re:Invent?
----------------------

\
From the [AWS re:Invent site](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/info/faq/):
\"AWS re:Invent is a learning conference hosted by Amazon Web Services
for the global cloud computing community. The event features keynote
announcements, training and certification opportunities. At the
conference, you'll have access to more than 1,000 technical sessions, a
partner expo, after-hours events, and so much more\".\
\

What Makes Sam Bisbee\'s Talk Different?
----------------------------------------

\
What is interesting in this talk is that instead of simply giving a
product demo, Sam shares his philosophy about creating a good
company-wide security policy at your company.\
\
\"The State of Security is the Absence of Unmitigatable Surprise.\" -
[Dan Geer, CISO, IN-Q-TEL](https://youtu.be/3W434qtLuyg)\
\
For those (like me) who are new to these updated terms: When Sam
mentions a \"See-So\", it is a **CISO**: [Chief Information Security
Officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_security_officer).\
\
Some examples:\
\

-   Don\'t just come up with a security policy and threaten people\'s
    jobs if they make a mistake and have that be that. Know what is
    happening. Look around. Close that feedback loop and adjust the
    security policy. 
-   Identify the top risks, and work with organization to mitigate that
    risk, putting in controls to monitor that it is working. 

Security is about identifying a risk \-- a vulnerability in our product,
a process, unlocked laptop:\

-   Use data to understand the risk
-   Attempt to control the risk
-   Remove it
-   Compensate for it

\
\... And, yes, I am already trying to recruit Sam as a speaker for the
[Ministry of Testing - Boston](http://bit.ly/mot_boston) Meetup.\
\
\
Happy Testing!\
