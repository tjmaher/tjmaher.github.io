\-\-- I\'ve been on many a job interview as a software tester these past
twenty years.\
\
On a job interview, to see how well candidates think on their feet, and
how dig they deep in their testing, the interviewer can talk about an
ordinary item to the candidates that is unrelated to software testing,
and ask the candidate how to test it.\
\
The item could be a phone. A calculator. A pen. Or even a chair.\

Exploratory Testing!
--------------------

**\
Usability testing**: You might have pictured yourself attempting to sit
in a chair, then get up from the chair, performing what we might term
usability testing.\
\
**Functionality testing**: If the office chair has lumbar support built
in, or can raise and lower the seat and the headrest.\
\
**Load Testing**: Imagining the normal usage of said chair, having
people with smaller or larger bodies than yours attempting to use the
chair.\
\
**Stress Testing**: Having a friend of yours sit on your lap, someone
else sitting on their lap, and keep on adding another person and another
person until the chair broke.\
\
**Performance testing**: Have a machine emulate getting up and sittign
down, then measuring how the force of a body sittign in a chair and
standign up affects the joints of the chair.\
**\
Security testing**: How easy is it to steal the chair?\
\
\... But this line of exploratory testing can only get you so far.\
\

Come Up With A List of Requirements! 
-------------------------------------

Without a list of business requirements, you don\'t know what features
the chair should have.\
\
\

-   If the office chair is black or brown, and the chair is actually
    supposed to be Day Glow pink, that is a bug.  
-   Should the headrest, the back rest, the seat be cushioned or should
    it be upholstered in leather for a fancy senior manager? 
-   If the requirements call for the seat, the back of the chair, and
    the headrest to be all one piece, and instead, you have an
    adjustable headrest, and two metal poles connecting it to the seat,
    that is a bug. 
-   What is the size and makeup of the back of the chair, the height and
    width of the back and seat of the chair? 
-   Should the chair have arms or not? How widely spaced should they be?
-   How high and wide should the seat be?
-   Does the chair have four legs? Or is it one pole leading to five
    separate feet, all with metal casters that allows the chair to move?

\

Are There Outside Quality Bodies You Could Bring Into The Conversation?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

\
If one of the requirements are that the chair should be *ergonomic*,
have you accurately scoped out what ergonomics mean? Have you checked
out the United States Department of Labor\'s Occupational Safety and
Health Administration or \"OSHA\" about what they mean by
\"ergonomics\"?\
\

Don\'t Forget To Test The Requirements!
---------------------------------------

\
\
If the chair does roll, is one the requirements for some type of brake
to stop the chair from rolling?\
If it is not in the requirements, should it be in the requirements?\
\
And those are all the things you need to think about when you test a
chair.\
\
\... If you have any creative and inventive ways of testing an office
chair write them in the Comments section below.\
