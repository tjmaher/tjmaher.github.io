Namaste! Hello, India! Welcome to this blog! I\'d offer you tea or a
mango lassi but you can\'t yet attach a beverage to a blog post.\
\
I\'d also translate this page to your native tongue but I don\'t know
Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri,
Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Meitei, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi,
Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, or Urdu\... so English will
have to do.\
\
I was checking Google Analytics and saw that I had over 800 unique
visitors to this site from your country in November 2017 alone.\
\
Although I started this blog almost three years ago as my own private
online collection of research notes, I get next to no feedback.\
\
\... Actually, that\'s not true. The bot that advertises Testing Jobs in
Chennai always leaves messages in the comments section. It thinks this
site is very helpful.\
\
How did you stumble on this blog? What do you like about it? I hope it
is useful to you. Is there anything I can help you with? Do you have any
doubts? Let me know in the Comments section below, or follow me on
Twitter at [\@tjmaher1](https://twitter.com/tjmaher1) and say hello!\
\
Happy Testing! Go Team India! Go Men in Blue! Go Virat Kohli!\
