Couldn\'t make it to November\'s TestBash Philly? Videos taken from the
conference are now online, posted on the central Ministry of Testing
site at
<https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/series/testbash-philadelphia-2017>\
\
Although some require a paid Pro subscription to the Testing Dojo, most
are accessible with the free Ministry of Testing Dojo subscription.\
\
**From the Dojo:**\
\
\"TestBash Philadelphia 2017 - our third TestBash in the USA was hosted
at The Fringe Arts on 9-10th November 2017.\
\
\"All TestBash events aim to inspire and educate but in equal measure
provide lots of opportunities for testers to meet, make friends and
continue to build the amazing testing community we have. A big part of
that at Philly this year was the first ever TestBash Circus, you can get
low-down on this and all the resources to run the circus activities on
[The
Dojo](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/series/testbash-circus-activities)
:::

\"We hosted 200 software testers from across the globe, had 10 great
talks, lots of awesome 99 second talks and plenty of socials!\
\
\"We record all our TestBash talks and make them available on The Dojo.
Some are free to watch and others require Pro Membership\... get stuck
in!\
\
\"Join the discussion about TestBash Philadelphia over at [The
Club](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/c/testbash/testbash-philadelphia).\
\
\"If you would like to attend TestBash or any of our events then please
check our latest schedule in our [events
section](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/events)\".\
\
\... For previews, take a look what I was live-tweeting on [Day
One](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/11/testbash-philly-day-1.html) and [Day
Two](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/11/testbash-philly-day-2.html).\

My favorites? All of the talks were so good it is difficult to pick
favorites. There were talks that surprised me, ones that could be
classified as being more related to \"soft skills\".\
\
**Ash Coleman**, [I\'ve Got A Feeling: Thoughts About Myself and The
State Of
Testing](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/i-ve-got-a-feeling-ash-coleman)
:::

-   Ash ( [\@ashcoleman30](https://twitter.com/AshColeman30) ) talks
    about being a woman of color in the tech industry, and how your
    company can become more diverse.
-   Ash Coleman and Angie Jones will be hosting TestBash 2018 in San
    Francisco.

\
**Christine McGarry**, [The Fellowship of the Test: Building a Community
Across Agile
Teams](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/the-fellowship-of-the-test-christine-mcgarry)\

-   Christine talks about creating at work \"The Fellowship of the
    Test\", a gathering of testers to spark collaboration and
    communication across multiple project teams. Beware the Technology
    Thicket! 

\
**Cassandra H. Leung**, [How to Benefit from Being
Uncomfortable](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/how-to-benefit-from-being-uncomfortable-cassandra-h-leung)\

-   Cassandra shares her experience with being an introvert, being in
    uncomfortable situations, and \"3 Steps for Proactive Success\". 

**\
Martin Hynie & Paul Holland**, [Was It Something I
Said?](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/was-it-something-i-said-martin-hynie-paul-holland)\
\

-   Throughout TestBash, Martin & Paul performed skits resembling Key &
    Peele\'s \"Luther, the Anger Translator\", about how to not truly
    say what you are really thinking. 
-   On Day 2, they wrap it up with a segment of how to resolve
    conflicts, and how to communicate effectively. 

\
I cannot wait until TestBash San Francisco!\
