\-\-- When it comes to programming languages, I am pretty language
agnostic. With only three years of work experience developing
automation, I am still learning, adopting whatever toolsets and
technologies my employer already is using.\
\
Sure, I still prefer Java, but only because it was my primary language
back in grad school. Although I only consider myself a junior Java
developer, I still think of it as my mother tongue.\

-   2014: As the manual tester supervising an offshore automation team,
    I tested out and tinkered with the Calabash / Ruby code they were
    using to automate mobile apps.
-   2015: Selenium WebDriver/ Java was used to write the automation
    framework in my first job as an automation developer.
-   2016: Pairing with the Node.js product, I adopted Nightwatch.js to
    write tests for a Vue.js JavaScript-based front end.
-   2017: Appium / Java was selected in a mobile testing
    proof-of-concept I was creating.
-   2018: My new upcoming SDET job uses Chef. Chef uses Ruby. Therefore
    I need to re-learn Ruby. 

But where to start re-learning Ruby?\

What The Heck is Ruby?
----------------------

\"Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on
simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to
read and easy to write.\
\
\"Ruby was created as a language of careful balance. Its
creator, [Yukihiro "Matz"
Matsumoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto), blended
parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp)
to form a new language that balanced functional programming with
imperative programming.\
\
\"He has often said that he is \"trying to make Ruby natural, not
simple,\" in a way that mirrors life.\
\
\"Building on this, he adds: \"Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very
complex inside, just like our human body.\"\
\
\"You can read more about the Ruby language [on its
site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/)\".*[ - Exercism / Ruby /
About](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby/about)*\
\

Get Your Feet Wet:
------------------

\
Ruby comes with IRB, the Interactive Ruby Shell, a REPL (Read / Evaluate
/ Print Loop) you can use to test out new code. Figure out how
on [Ruby-lang.org](http://ruby-lang.org/), the official site!\

-   [Download and Install
    Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) 
-   Go through [Ruby in Twenty
    Minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/),
    using Interactive Ruby
-   Learn all about instance variables, objects, etc.
-   Tinker
    with [Documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/).
-   Only have ten minutes? [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/).
-   Learn the Ruby culture ( [and some
    history](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/ruby_ruby_on_rails_and__why_the_disappearance_of_one_of_the_world_s_most_beloved_computer_programmers_.html)
    ) with \"[Why\'s (poignant) Guide to
    Ruby](https://poignant.guide/)\", and the origin of \"Chunky
    Bacon\".

Start Learning the Fundamentals:
--------------------------------

-   If you are brand new to coding, I would say that you should work
    first through Zed Shaw\'s \"[Learning Ruby The Hard
    Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)\", written for the
    non-coder, good for the manual tester learning the first programming
    language. Since I always feel shaky first learning a new language, I
    started here.
-   CodeAcademy [has a Learn Ruby
    course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby) that is
    absolutely free! It will take you through Looping, Data Structures
    such as Arrays, Hashes, Blocks, Procs, Lambdas, and lessons in
    Object Oriented programming. I really enjoyed this course!
-   Ruby-Doc.org shows the [API documentation for Ruby
    2.5.0](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.0/), released December 2017.
    Practice looking up new Ruby keywords on Ruby-doc.org while you are
    reading any Ruby programming book.
-   Ruby-lang.org, the [official site for the Ruby
    Language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). Start exploring the tutorials
    there.
-   [Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer\'s
    Guide](http://docs.ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/), for
    intermediate developers, is free on the web! I may not have
    understood all I read, but I plowed through the book within a week.

<div>

Just like **Java** libraries can be accessed in
[http://mvnrepository.com](http://mvnrepository.com/) and **Node.JS**
libraries can be accessed in <https://www.npmjs.com/>:\
\

-   Ruby libraries, aka \"Ruby Gems\", are accessible
    at <https://rubygems.org/>
-   Ruby Gems that are bundled together: [Bundle.io](http://bundle.io/)

<div>

For Unit Tests there is:

</div>

<div>

-   [MiniTest](http://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/): Built for Ruby 2.0.
    [See it on
    Ruby-docs.org](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/minitest/rdoc/MiniTest.html). [See
    it on GitHub](http://github.com/seattlerb/minitest).
-   [Rspec](http://rspec.info/): Behavior Driven Development for Ruby.
    Check out the demos videos! Aslak Hellesøy, the [creator of
    Cucumber](http://www.tjmaher.com/search?q=cucumber), was one of the
    initial developers of this toolset.

</div>

Do I really need to know all of this Ruby code to learn Chef and
Kitchen?\
\
\... Maybe not. But my goal, when I learn automation, is to learn more
than just running the automation tool itself. My goal is to code as well
as a software developer!  

</div>

<div>

** Keep Practicing!**
---------------------

</div>

-   [Codewars.org](http://codewars.org/) has daily challenges consisting
    of small problems you can review over morning coffee.
-   HackerRank also has [Ruby problems in the guise of
    tutorials](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ruby/ruby-tutorials). 
     

\
Another way to practice? [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/).\
\
Franklin Webber, the Chef specialist and Ruby developer who developed
the webinar, [The Ruby Behind
Chef](http://www.tjmaher.com/2018/01/the-ruby-behind-chef.html),
recommended another way to keep practicing: a site
called [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/), an open-source project that
anyone can use to \"Level Up Your Programming Skills\".\
\
A future blog entry will chart my experience with the Exercism site.\
\
\

Rudimentary Ruby
----------------

<div>

\

</div>

Here\'s a bit of practice that I did after getting to know the basics
and reading the Ruby docs:\
\
\
Let\'s see what a **String** can do in Ruby using the [Ruby-doc.org core
docs](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html).\
\
puts \"hello world\"      *\# Prints out the String object, \"hello
world\"*\
puts \"hello world\".capitalize  *\# \"Hello World\"*\
puts \"hello world\".clear  *\# \"\"*\
puts \"hello world\".count  *\# 11 letters*\
puts \"hello world.delete \"h\" *\# \"ello world\"*\
puts \"HELLO WORLD\".downcase \# \"hello world\"\
puts \"hello world\".insert(6, \'there \') \# \"hello there world\"\
puts \"hello world\".length \# Length of 11\
puts \"hello world\".reverse \# \"dlrow olleh\"\
puts \"hello world\".upcase *\# \"HELLO WORLD\"*\
puts \"hello world\".split *\# Returns two words: \"hello\" and
\"world\"*\
*\
***Array**, in
[Docs.Ruby-Lang.org](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Array.html):\
\
puts browsers = \[\"Chrome\", \"Firefox\", \'MS Edge\'\] *\# Lists
Chrome, then Firefox, then MS Edge*\
puts \"Number of Browsers: *\#{browsers.length}\" \# Number of Browsers:
3*\
browsers.each { \|x\| puts \"\#{x}: Loading browser\... \" }\
\
Yes! I am now halfway done with CodeAcademy!\
\
As soon as I am done with the [CodeAcademy course in
Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby), where I really am
getting familiar with the fundamentals of the language, I can start
stretching myself with Exercism.io.\
\
See you then! Happy Testing!\
