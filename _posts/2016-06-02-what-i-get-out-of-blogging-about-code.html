<div>On my lunchbreak, I was trying to explain to my co-workers what I get out of blogging about code I am writing at work.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>You know the expression, if you really want to see if you know something, try describing it to someone else?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>That's why I blog.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Software development is brand new to me. It was scary when I first started. I was completely out of my comfort zone. But it got better.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>What I am learn at work has been a good foundation. There, I learn about the&nbsp;<i>what</i>, and the&nbsp;<i>how</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>It isn't until I start organizing my thoughts, creating a blog post, do I figure out the&nbsp;<i>why</i>.</div><div><ul><li>How did the software development process I am using take hold? Who first blogged about the concepts I am using? Was it <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck" target="_blank">Kent Beck</a>? <a href="http://martinfowler.com/" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a>? <a href="http://blog.rocketpoweredjetpants.com/" target="_blank">Simon Stewart</a>? <a href="http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Jim Evans</a>?&nbsp;<a href="http://butunclebob.com/" target="_blank">Uncle Bob</a>?&nbsp;</li><li>Who made the toolset I am using? When did it become adopted? Is it industry standard?</li><li>Although I may not understand it, where on GitHub is the open-source code? Can I understand how their project is constructed? Are there unit test formats I can borrow for my automation development?&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Through blogging, for me, comes <i>understanding</i>.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>And that's my thought of the day!</div><div><br /></div>Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
