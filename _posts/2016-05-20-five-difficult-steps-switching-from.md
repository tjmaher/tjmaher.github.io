\-\-- It wasn\'t too long ago when I was an out-of-work software tester
without much experience coding. There are many manual testers \-- people
who test web and mobile applications the same way customers use them,
with a mouse, a keyboard, or a finger on a touch screen \-- who are
trying to switch to automated testing. I wrote [at length
elsewhere](http://techbeacon.com/switching-careers-qa-manual-testing-automation-development)
about my transition. With this blog post, I wanted to list more of a
summary, hoping that other people in the same boat as I was would find
it helpful.\

Coding: Getting used to it
--------------------------

\
To get used to coding again, I worked through all of the examples in the
free eBook **Learning Python the Hard Way**:
<http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/> to get used to working with a
programming language. I really needed the hand-holding this book
offered. Working with Python helped, since it is a language with less
ramp up time.\
\
Then, I purchased **Java for Testers** at <http://javafortesters.com/>
to ease me into the Java programming language. Anything by [The Evil
Tester](http://eviltester.com/), himself, Alan Richardson, is made of
awesome.\
\
[Java 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) and [Python
2.7.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/) seem to
be the heavy hitters, when it comes to programming languages. Some
companies are still trying to transition from Java 7 to Java 8, but they
will do it eventually. Python 3? It came out years ago and hasn\'t been
fully adopted yet. People would rather stick with Python 2 and pull in
new features than switch to Python 3.\
\

Doing the Coursework
--------------------

\
I purchased Alan Richardson\'s online course **Selenium 2 WebDriver
Basics with Java**:
https://compendiumdev.zenler.com/courses/selenium-2-webdriver-basics-with-java
(\$299) \... Work through all the Preview material if you can to see if
you like his course, his videos, his humor, and his Scottish accent.\
\
I used Alan Richardson\'s mildly outdated **Selenium Simplified** free
guide to **Get Started**: <http://seleniumsimplified.com/get-started/>
\... I set up [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as an
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on my home PC. Either this or
[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) seems to be the new standard.\
\

Doing the Coursework right!
---------------------------

\
When working through an online course, if it is showing in the video
someone typing code into IntelliJ, I am typing, too!\
\
The left half of my screen contains the video playing in a browser. The
right half of my screen is filled is my IntelliJ window.\
\
\... The instructor types? I type. The video executes the code? I do
too\... I accidentally wasted two months simply passively listening to
the lectures. I retained completely no information I supposedly
learned.\
\

Create Code of My Own
---------------------

\
Once I got a hang of things, I started looking around for things to
automate, such as Dave Haeffner\'s test site, \"The Internet\" on
<https://github.com/tourdedave/the-internet> and
<http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/> .\
\

Share the Code!
---------------

\
I signed up for a GitHub account, creating a coding portfolio displaying
automation coding examples I came up with:
<https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>\
\
Once I had the GitHub account filled with coding examples, I could prove
to employers that I had what it takes to do the job.\
\
Hope that helps!\
\
Happy Testing!\
