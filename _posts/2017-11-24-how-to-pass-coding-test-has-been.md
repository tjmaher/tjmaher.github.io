\-\-- It took more than a few sleepless nights, but my pre-recorded
video, \"**How To Pass A Coding Interview As An Automation
Developer**\", was finally worthy of being submitted to the
[AutomationGuild.com](http://automationguild.com/)!\

Summer 2016 was tough for me. It was the first time I realized that
Whiteboard Coding Tests \-- getting up in front of a whiteboard and
solving various coding problems as found on
[LeetCode.com](http://leetcode.com/) \-- was the norm when going on
automation developer interviews.\
\
This may sound odd, but I couldn\'t understand, at first, why
interviewers were asking me to code in real time in front of them. What
did automation development have to do with software development? \... It
took me a while to realize that *automation development* was *software
development*.\
\
Based on my experience, I [wrote an article on
TechBeacon](https://techbeacon.com/how-pass-coding-interview-automation-developer)
back in September 2016 that I then turned into a presentation and [gave
to the Ministry of Testing - Boston
Meetup](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/11/video-10172016-how-to-pass-coding.html)
a month later.\
\
This year, I decided that, even though I was new at this and it scared
the heck of me, I really wanted to try my hand at public speaking. I
submitted proposals to [STPCon.com](http://stpcon.com/) and the Ministry
of Testing without any luck. I was then contacted by Joe Colantonio from
[TestTalks.com](http://testtalks.com/) to see if I wanted submit a
pre-recorded video to his online conference, the
[AutomationGuild.com](http://automationguild.com/), and be a guest
speaker.\
\
It took me a few nights, but it is finally done!\
\
As stressful as it was in the beginning\... by the time it was done, I
was having a lot of fun with it.\
\
\... I wonder if I could turn Adventures in Automation into a video
blog?\
\
Happy Testing!\
