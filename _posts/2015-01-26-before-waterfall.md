Here are a few ancestors to the waterfall method:

### **Production of Large Computer Programs,** *1956*

Adapted from a presentation he had given at an event sponsored by the
Navy Mathematical Computing Advisory Panel and the Office of Naval
Research in June 1956, Herbert D. Benington talked about his experience
working on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system at MIT\'s
Lincoln Laboratory.\

Programs**, 1956

the various stages as:

### Managing the Development of Large Software System, *1970*

<div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

The August 1970 issue of IEEE WESCON published an article by Dr. Winston
W. Royce, director of Lockheed Software Technology. The article was
titled, **Managing the Development of Large Software Systems,** 1970
([PDF](http://www.serena.com/docs/agile/papers/Managing-The-Development-of-Large-Software-Systems.pdf))
 He detailed how in his nine years of experience with developing
software packages for spacecraft mission planning, he saw many successes
and failures in projects.

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

He talks about how many projects he comes across are designed in what we
would recognize as the Waterfall method: Generate System Requirements,
Software Requirements, Perform Analysis, Program Design, Coding,
Testing, then Operations.

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

He recommended a few changes, such as doing the preliminary program
design first, then documenting the design. How much documentation?
\"\'Quite a lot\' \[\...\] certainly more than most programmers,
analysts, or program designers are willing to do if left to their own
devices\". If the document is in default, replace project management. He
also recommends planning on writing the software product twice: A first
pass, then once more after the customer sees the product. Involve the
customer in the testing.

### Software Engineering Economics, *1983*

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

Barry Boehm was Founding Director of the Center for Systems and Software
Engineering at the University of Southern California. He published a
paper **Software Engineering Economics**, 1983
([PDF](http://csse.usc.edu/csse/TECHRPTS/1984/usccse84-500/usccse84-500.pdf))
which detailed the steps as:

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

<div>

> **Feasibility Phase**. \"How much should we invest in information
> system\
> analyses (user questionnaires and interviews, current-system
> analysis,\
> workload characterizations, simulations, scenarios, prototypes) in
> order\
> to converge on an appropriate definition and concept of operation for\
> the system we plan to implement?\"

</div>

<div>

> **Plans and Requirements Phase**. \"How rigorously should we specify\
> requirements? How much should we invest in requirements validation\
> activities (automated completeness, consistency, and traceability\
> checks, analytic models, simulations, prototypes) before proceeding
> to\
> design and develop a software system?\"

</div>

<div>

> **Product Design Phase**. \"Should we organize the software to make
> it\
> possible to use a complex piece of existing software that generally
> but\
> not completely meets our requirements?\"

</div>

<div>

> **Programming Phase**. \"Given a choice between three data storage
> and\
> retrieval schemes that are primarily execution-time efficient,
> storage\
> efficient, and easy to modify, respectively, which of these should we\
> choose to implement?\"

</div>

<div>

> **Integration and Test Phase**. \"How much testing and formal
> verification\
> should we perform on a product before releasing it to users?\"

</div>

<div>

> **Maintenance Phase**. \"Given an extensive list of suggested product\
> improvements, which ones should we implement first?\"

</div>

<div>

> **Phaseout**. \"Given an aging, hard-to-modify software product,
> should we\
> replace it with a new product, restructure it, or leave it alone?\"

</div>

</div>

<div>

\

</div>

<div>

\... The Software Development Life Cycle is ever changing, where people
are always trying to find the quickest and most efficient way to design,
create, and test software. 

</div>

Next, I will go into Extreme Programming and the Agile Software
Development Methodology.
