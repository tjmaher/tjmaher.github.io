\-\-- Right now, I am heading to another Ministry of Testing - Boston
meetup. Tonight\'s special guest will be Angie Jones!\

Like a director hosting a Q & A session at a film festival after a movie
has been screened, after watching her April 2017 \"The Build That Cried
Broken\" http://youtu.be/VotJqV4n8ig Angie Jones, newly employed at
Twitter, will be giving a talk via webconference.

We have 20 people signed up. I hope at least 15 show!

I swear, we have four hundred new members since January 2017 (700 total)
and only ten might show on average. I wonder if it is the location, if
iZotope or Cengage Learning are too out of the way?

I have an enormous bag of swag to give away. SmartBear hoodies, pens and
stickers. Sauce Labs T-Shirts and bike reflectors. Ministry of Testing
stickers and pins. I just have more swag than attendees!

It was a good day today. I gave an hour presentation and demo on this
Summer\'s Appiuum projects. I think it went well!

Here\'s hoping!
