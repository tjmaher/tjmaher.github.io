\-\-- Wow. I can\'t believe that yesterday\'s post on [Simon Stewart
talking about Selenium
WebDriver](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/05/notes-selenium-3-spec-and-onwards-by.html)
was the 100th post I have created here at **Adventures in Automation**.\
\
This blog was started back on January 24, 2015 as a place to organize my
research notes I collected as I was trying to break into the world of
automated test development. Now that I am a full-fledged automated test
developer, I continue to blog about whatever I am learning at work to
help make the new concept stick, inventing new little side-projects to
reinforce what I am learning. Hopefully these articles and [code
samples](https://github.com/tjmaher?tab=repositories) have helped you,
too!\
\
The act of putting together this blog has made me a better software
developer.\
\
Thank you, dear reader, for being a part of it.\
