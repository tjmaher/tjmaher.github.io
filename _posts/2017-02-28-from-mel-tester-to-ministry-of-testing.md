\"You all are well on your way to being a part of the large Ministry of
Testing community. One of the ways you can do that is to contribute to
the community at-large.\
\
\"There are opportunities to contribute by creating content for the
[Ministry of Testing](http://www.ministryoftesting.com/) organization
and [The Dojo](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/).\
\
\"Writing articles for Ministry of Testing is one of the ways to get
your thoughts and ideas out into the community, teach others new
techniques or offer tricks and point out traps for old ones. The testing
community needs a big voice, a big presence to help define the future of
testing. You can be part of it.\
