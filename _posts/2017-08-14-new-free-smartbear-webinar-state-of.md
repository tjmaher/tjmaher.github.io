\-\-- A few months ago, a sponsor of the [Ministry of Testing -
Boston](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/240191225/),
SmartBear software, hosted a survey, \"The State of Software Testing\".
Over five thousand people filled out the survey. The results are ready
to be revealed!\
\
\"Did you know that 63% of testers are responsible for testing both the
frontend and backend of their applications? Or that API tests are more
likely to be automated than GUI tests?\
\
\"Discover what your peers are doing today in testing - the applications
they're building and the techniques they're using. Learn more about
modern test environments and how many teams are at the 'tipping point'
of shifting left.\
\
\"SmartBear collected insights from thousands of developers, testers,
and managers worldwide who are passionate about software testing. They
openly shared their experiences, insights, and the challenges they face
in their day-to-day roles.\
\
\"Join a panel of SmartBear experts as they walk through the 2017 'State
of Testing Survey' and divulge the key trends and observations we
uncovered\".\
