\-\-- *This is part five of of a seven-part blog series. Care to
go [back to the
beginning](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/05/basic-appium-framework-part-one.html)?*\
\
Now that we have set up a rudimentary framework, now it\'s time for you
to download the framework we have created onto your own local machine.
We will be using IntelliJ\'s built in feature\... But you could easily
use GitHub Desktop or could even use Git.\
\
\... Do you have a GitHub account? Get one! Then go through the
tutorials they show you. They can teach you more than this blog ever
could.\
\
[]{#more}\
\
1) Go to the GitHub site of this project
at https://github.com/tjmaher/basic\_appium\_framework\
\
2) Press the green Clone or Download button. Here, if you wanted to, you
could simply download the sourcecode to your machine as a Zip file.\
\
3) Copy the Git file of the project to the clipboard. It is:
 https://github.com/tjmaher/basic\_appium\_framework.git\
\
4) Launch IntelliJ, go to the main menu, and select \"Check out from
Version Control\", and choose GitHub.\

\
5) Change AUTH Type to Password, enter your username and password, and
press Login.\
\
6)  What is your username on your machine? And where do you like placing
your coding projects? Normally, I place them in a sub-directory of Home,
a folder I created called \"code\".\
\

-   Git Repository URL:
    https://github.com/tjmaher/basic\_appium\_framework.git
-   Parent Directory: /Users/tmaher/
-   Directory Name: basic\_appium\_framework

\
7) Press the Clone Button.\
\
\... Now? The project will be cloned onto your machine.\
\
Feel free to play around with the code, and write some tests of your
own!\
