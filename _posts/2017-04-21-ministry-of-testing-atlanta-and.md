\-\-- I really didn\'t expect many people to show up for [this month\'s
Lean
Coffee](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/239012934/) at
John Harvard\'s Brewery in Harvard Square. We\'ve been getting around
five to ten people showing up since I held the first one back in
February. Six people signed up for the Meetup event, so I expected maybe
it would be four people in attendance? Me plus three? This time, though,
I was in for a surprise!\
\
I\'ve been reaching out to other Ministry of Testing chapters here in
the United States.
[Philly](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-philadelphia/).
[Portland,
Oregon](https://www.meetup.com/Ministry-of-Testing-Portland/).
[Atlanta](https://www.meetup.com/Ministry-of-Testing-Atlanta/). Likewise,
**Claire Moss**, co-organizer of MoT-Atlanta, while she was attending a
Boston area Agile conference, has been looking to connect to other MoT
groups. Her motto on her business card? \"Using my evil powers for
good!\"\

Claire is a bundle of energy! She organizes Meetup events in Atlanta,
she blogs on [Aclairefication.com](http://aclairefication.com/), she
live Tweets events, and schedules impromptu events like bringing an
entourage of people from a nearby Alliance Testing conference to crash
our Meetup with her.\

After meeting-and-greeting the newcomers, I was about to start the Lean
Coffee. As soon as one of the attendees saw me pull out dry-erase
markers and Post-It notes from my black messenger bag, he inquired,
\"You want me to run the **Lean Coffee**?\" *\... Sure! Why not, I
thought?* It would be fun participating with the other Ministry of
Testing - Boston members. How familiar was he with the concept? He
mentioned, \"Oh, I [was there when they first had the
idea](http://leancoffee.org/)\".\
\
So, for the rest of the evening we had [Llewellyn
Falco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/llewellyn-falco-406742/) ([\@LlewellynFalco](https://twitter.com/LlewellynFalco)),
Agile Coach, author of [The Mob Programming
Handbook](https://leanpub.com/mobprogrammingguidebook), and co-founder
of [Teaching Kids Programming](http://teachingkidsprogramming.org/),
running our Lean Coffee for us\... Sometimes life just surprises you!\

It was a lot of fun listening to Llewellyn\'s snappy patter as the
conversation zipped along from topic to topic!\

-   Testing: Building Quality, not into the Product, but to the Process!
-   Get good at making hard-stuff easy to automate (not automating hard
    stuff).
-   When choosing what to test, don\'t expect zero defects \-- Learn in
    Production!
-   DevOps has QA as a Customer.

My favorite thing I shared? \"The primary purpose of a QA Engineer is
that of an End User Advocate\".

My favorite quote from Llewellyn: \"Struggle is good for learning, but
frustration is death!\"
