Normally, I am an upbeat person. When I am a good mood, you can tell. I
have a grin that goes from ear-to-ear. I laugh easily and heartily. If I
had a tail, I\'d always be wagging it! And \-- my poor, poor wife \-- I
love making bad puns.\
\
But there is nothing that taxes me more than job searching! It is
unnerving, stressful, stammer producing. And the longer the job search
continues, the harder it gets.\
\
Basically, all the excess energy I had to finish the \"Testing the
Twitter API\" disappeared. I\'ll be able to finish it once I find a
position, but now, I am spending most of my free time looking at
Indeed.com, Dice.com, and LinkedIn Jobs.\

Looking to see how I started my career? Take a look at the early
articles posted on my [Table of

\
Happy Testing!\
