After a quick meet-and-greet, the talk can begin!\
\
*6:34 pm*\
Paul Roberts, Editor-In-Chief of [The Security
Ledger](https://securityledger.com/editorial-staff/) and founder of [The
Security of Things
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-Security-of-Things/) spoke briefly.
This was the second security meetup this month. Last week, the group was
at Akamai.\
\
Paul introduced, Chris Stasonis, Senior Engineering Manager at Fitbit,
who Paul reached out to a few months ago, so the Security of Things
meetup could host a meetup When the San Francisco based Security team
came to visit the Boston office.\
\
Chris mentioned that the Boston office has been around for almost three
years, primarily as an engineering office, with a huge firmware
department, and a lot of exciting products going on.\
\
If you are a firmware engineer, check out <http://fitbit.com/jobs>.\
\
Sasha Birkup, Directory of Security, spoke a bit about the team. The
current Security Organization is around 13 people. They are building out
a security features team. The features team consists more of developers
who want to focus on security than security who want to dictate to
developers.\
\
Sasha mentioned that Fitbit is ultimately a startup and has startup like
issues such as competing for resources, and that time to market is king
and queen. Field testing and QA are high commodities. And the best part
of Fitbit is that the two co-founders are technical. The CEO, James
Park, can be considered the first security officer.\

\
Members of the team spoke about how they focus not just on Firmware and
Hardware, but web & mobile applications, too, making sure they are all
secure from end-to-end.\
\
They also do what I found to be unique when auditing code for security
issues: Code reviews. They check to see if an API, for example which is
known not to be safe, is being used. They look for interesting commits
that may have code vulnerabilities.\
\
They also use accurate threat modeling as a basis for discussion of
which risks that are priorities, examining the external boundaries
first, then internal ones.\

\
The security team mentioned that they do offer Bug Bounties for bugs
found. You can check out **Bugcrowd** at <https://bugcrowd.com/fitbit>.
Please note: This program does not allow disclosure. With the bug bounty
program, you should not release information about vulnerabilities found
in this program to the public.\

> bring thousands of good hackers to the fight, helping companies even
