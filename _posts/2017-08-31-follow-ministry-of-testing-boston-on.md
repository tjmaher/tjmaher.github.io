\-\-- I am happy to announce that I am the new Organizer of the Ministry
of Testing, Boston chapter! \... or, at least that is what I have dubbed
myself.\
\
Back in January 2017, when the Greater Boston QA and Testing Meetup
moved under the [Ministry of
Testing](http://www.ministryoftesting.com/)\'s umbrella, a community of
software testers in the UK that was expanding into the United States,
three things happened:\
\

-   The Meetup group was rebranded the \"[Ministry of Testing -
    Boston](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston)\".
-   I was invited by the founder of the group, Conrad Holloman, to be
    co-organizer, helping to plan meetups.   
-   After month or so, I was asked if I could mind the store for the
    Spring. Between Conrad going back on duty and needing to put more
    effort in running a group he co-founded, [Operation
    Code](https://medium.com/operation-code) \-- training veterans in a
    new software development career \-- he wouldn\'t be available. 

After six months of me going all gung-ho, running targeted Facebook and
Twitter ads for the group, running two or more events a month,
cold-calling and cold-emailing to see if they could host a Meetup event
and possibly speak to our group\... Conrad mentioned that he was
stepping down. Could I possibly fill the Organizer role?\
\
I have to say, I am having the most fun with the group! I have been
recruiting friends of mine to speak to the group. I somehow managed to
get [Moshe
Milman](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/06/notes-on-moshe-milmans-talk-advanced.html),
the CEO of Applitools to the group. [Angie
Jones](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/07/q-with-angie-jones-ministry-of-testing.html),
via web conference spoke live from Twitter\'s San Francisco office.
Sauce Labs is now a major sponsor.\
