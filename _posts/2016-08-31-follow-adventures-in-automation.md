\-\-- August has been a busy month.\
\

-   Currently, I am searching for new automation development
    opportunities. 
-   I\'ve spent much of my free time preparing for whiteboard coding
    interviews, and juggling many, many on-site interviews. 
-   I\'ve been working on a new TechBeacon.com article, \"How To Pass A
    Coding Interview As An Automation Developer\". It should be
    published by the end of September.
