\-\-- I can\'t remember how [Angie Jones](https://angiejones.tech/) (
[\@techgirl1908](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908) ) and I first
connected two years ago. Did she stumble on my blog first? Or did I drop
her a line on Twitter first? No matter.\
\
For the past couple of years, I\'ve been an Angie Jones superfan.\
\

\
I\'ve been loving how she has put herself out there for the software
testing community, giving many [unique automation
talks](https://angiejones.tech/category/talks/) that I\'d watch on
YouTube, and then chat with about them with her on Twitter.\
\
And Angie\'s been reading this blog, [reviewing demo
projects](http://www.tjmaher.com/p/programming-projects.html) I have
been doing as I tried to re-learn coding after a ten year absence,
always encouraging me to keep up the good work.\

When I needed a speaker at a Ministry of Testing - Boston Meetup event
back in July 2017, [she
volunteered](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/07/q-with-angie-jones-ministry-of-testing.html),
videoconferencing my group all the way from Twitter\'s San Francisco
office.\
\
And when Twitter needed an automation developer, she thought of me,
writing the most beautiful referral I have ever seen to her manager. I
didn\'t get the position, but I did get two phone screenings, a coding
test, and good exposure to a very interesting API testing tool. ( [Click

sample](https://github.com/tjmaher/tinkeringWithTwitter) ).\
\
After the interview process was complete, I asked Angie if she could
post the referral she sent to her manager to my LinkedIn profile. She
did.\

> not afraid to continue to grow, in fact, he thrives on it. He would be
> an amazing asset to any team looking to enhance their automation

Thank you, Angie, for your continued support! It is much appreciated!\
\
Happy Testing!\
