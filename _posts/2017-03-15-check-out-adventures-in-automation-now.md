\-\-- Adventures in Automation is now two years old! It\'s messy. It\'s
busy, with text scribbled in every margin. And it\'s my online home.\
\
It also can be difficult to read, with a layout not as clean as today\'s
modern WordPress formats. I do like the cute little Matrix-In-Blue
theme, but it can be kinda distracting.\
\
Because it would take a lot of work for me to port all of the almost 190
posts I have written to somewhere else, this weekend I reviewed all
posts of mine and am in the process of moving the better posts to
**Medium.com** at <https://medium.com/@tjmaher1>\... one at a time!\
\
I\'ve scheduled one revamped entry to be posted per day over the next
two weeks. Feel free to follow and favorite what you like!\
\
\
Happy Reading!\
