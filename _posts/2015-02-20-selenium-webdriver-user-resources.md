\-\-- There has been a sudden shift in the software testing industry. As
companies are trying to make their software development life cycle run
faster and faster, the lines have blurred between Software Quality
Assurance and Software Development. If you are a QA Engineer, in order
to speed up the regression tests \-- checking that the new additions to
the product didn\'t break the old functionality \-- you now need to
learn how to code. And Selenium WebDriver \-- the open-source software
that couples with Java, Python, or other languages to simulate a user
operating a web application in a browser \-- has been the tool to use.\
\
But where can you find good, solid information on how to use Selenium
WebDriver?\
\

\
Here are a collection of resources that I have been using to learn about
Selenium WebDriver:\
\

### Selenium HQ: 

<http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/>\
\
The official site of the Selenium WebDriver project contains information
such as:\
\
[An Introduction to the Selenium
Project](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/index.jsp) discussing:\
\

-   Whether or not you should use automation to test your web
    application.
-   A Brief History of The Selenium Project
-   An introduction to a rapid prototyping tool, Selenium IDE that
    beginners can use.

\
[WebDriver
Documentation](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp)  where
you can read about [Setting up a Selenium WebDriver
Project](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp#setting-up-a-selenium-webdriver-project)
, get an introduction to the [WebDriver
API](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp#introducing-the-selenium-webdriver-api-by-example) (Application
Program Interface)  and see examples accessing the Selenium WebDriver
code in Java, C\#, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, or Javascript.\
\
It also contains documentation on [Advanced
Topics](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#chapter04-reference)
such as:\
\

-   [Using Explicit and Implicit
    Waits](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#explicit-and-implicit-waits) where
    you can wait for the elements on the page of your web application to
    load before manipulating them.
-   [Selenium
    Grid](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.jsp)  which
    allows you to run your tests in different browsers on different
    machines in parallel. You set up a Hub to organize the tests, and
    set up one Node each for each browser/ platform.

The [Download Page](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/) walks you
through which WebDriver and offers many different computer language
bindings such as Java or Python.

The Selenium Wiki isn\'t organized neatly like Wikipedia. It is an
assortment of seventy or so documents discussing advanced material like
the [Chrome](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver),
[Ruby](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings),
[Firefox](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriverInternals),
[Internet
Explorer](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver),
[Opera](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/OperaDriver), and even
the [Safari](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/SafariDriver)
drivers which interacts between Selenium and each respective browser.

There is also a paper on the [JSON Wire
Pr[otocol]{style="font-family: inherit;"}](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol)[ describing
how data \-- formatted in Javascript Object Notation \-- goes across the
network (the wire) by way of HTTP calls.  You can read more about the
basics behind JSON and REST from [Dr. Dobbs: RESTful Web Services: A
Tutorial](http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/restful-web-services-a-tutorial/240169069) *(9/23/2014)*. ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\

use to ask questions about Selenium:]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\
]{style="font-family: inherit;"}[The Selenium Users Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-users): Trying

### [Blogs:]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

[[The Official Selenium Blog](https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/): By
SeleniumHQ, this blog only has periodic updates. An interesting feature
are the recorded Google Hangouts where you can listen to the main people
who commit to the Selenium WebDriver codebase talk about updates about
the Selenium community.  ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
\
[[Selenium Simplified](http://seleniumsimplified.com/): Alan
Richardson \@EvilTester is a consultant who focuses on software testing.
I loved his course I discovered on Udemy, [Selenium 2: WebDriver Basics
with
Java](https://www.udemy.com/selenium-2-webdriver-basics-with-java/#/) so
I follow his blog. ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}\
[\

Blogs](http://it-kosmopolit.de/Selenium/blog/selenium-blogs/selenium_blogs.php): Michael
Wowro \-- who writes a German blog, IT Kosmopolit \-- keeps a running
index on all blogs that he finds on Selenium WebDriver.\

> Although this Udemy.com course is \$299, I found it was well worth it.
> Alan Richardson \@EvilTester has a knack explaining complex problems
> simply, breaking things down step-by-step. Once complaint could be
> that the material is too extensive. There are 230+ short lectures
> covering the basics, but also including all the intermediate and
> advanced material you could ever want.  

> Alan walks you through installing Selenium WebDriver, Java, and
> IntelleJ, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) he prefers to
> use to write in Java, and how to use Maven to update the environment.
> Other topics are about how to test in different browsers, PageObjects,
> Continuous Integration using Jenkins, Data Driven Testing, and using
> Selenium Grid and Sauce Labs.

[Elemental Selenium](http://elementalselenium.com/):\
\

> A weekly emailed newsletter run by Dave Haeffner \-- has an archived
> collection of [Tips](http://elementalselenium.com/tips) you can view.
> I have yet to review his [Selenium
> Guidebook](https://seleniumguidebook.com/) since the Java edition
> doesn\'t come out until March. Dave also wrote about [Selenium
> Bootcamp](https://saucelabs.com/resources/selenium-bootcamp). He also
> organizes the [Selenium
> Hangouts](https://twitter.com/SeleniumHangout). 

\
Sauce Labs:\
\

> [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) was started by Jason Huggins, the
> author of Selenium before it merged with WebDriver. They back the
> [Appium](http://appium.io/) open-source project that allows users to
> automate using Selenium on mobile devices. They have a good tutorial
> in [Java](https://docs.saucelabs.com/tutorials/java/), and many
> [other](https://docs.saucelabs.com/) language bindings for Selenium.
