\-\-- From [Best of TechBeacon 2016: Performance Revs
Up](https://techbeacon.com/best-techbeacon-2016-performance-revs) (*12/30/2016*):\
\
*\"Trends like exploding mobile app use and test automation tools are
transforming the role of performance testers and QA staff everywhere.
The field continues to offer plenty of opportunities for career
growth---for those who know how to adapt and respond to the changes that
are happening around the discipline \[\...\]*\

\... It\'s been an amazing year for me professionally, with a lot of
ups-and-down in my career.\
\

-   Finally getting settled in as a newly-minted automation developer,
    [publishing an
    article](https://techbeacon.com/switching-careers-qa-manual-testing-automation-development)
    about the experience, the first article I have ever published. 
-   That job getting up-ended in a management shift, [publishing an
    article](https://techbeacon.com/how-pass-coding-interview-automation-developer)
    about that painful job search, and what I learned from it. 
-   Turning that job-searching article into a [thirty-minute
    talk](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/11/video-10172016-how-to-pass-coding.html),
    the first one I have ever given. I presented it to the Greater
    Boston QA and Testing Meetup. 
-   When the Greater Boston QA and Testing Meetup rebranded itself as
    [Ministry of Testing -
    Boston](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/), the
    founder of the group invited me to be a co-organizer. 

\
Here is what to expect with **Adventures in Automation** in 2017:\
\

-   Part 4 and 5 of [Testing The-Internet with Geb + Groovy +
    Spock](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/11/testing-internet-with-geb-groovy-spock.html).
-   An Introduction to Nightwatch.js, a Node.js and JavaScript
    framework. 
-   Notes and highlights from Ministry of Testing - Boston Meetup events
    I am organizing.
-   Behind-the-scenes glances as I try to use the skills I picked up
    doing event planning for the Nerd Fun - Boston Meetup and use them
    as a new co-organizer for Ministry of Testing - Boston.

\
\
Happy Testing, and have a Happy New Year!\
