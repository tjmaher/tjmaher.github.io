\-\-- So, I just added my second small Selenium / Java test to Fitbit -
Boston\'s automated test suite of its eCommerce application. Up until
now, my main focus was helping out with manual testing. Doing automation
was mainly a side project as I was ramping up since our QA department
was short-staffed.\

[]{#more}\
\
\... And when do I become an \"official\" automated tester?\
\
Oh, yeah\... probably when I stop counting out how many merges to the
codebase I am doing.  :)\
\
I am so glad that I have this opportunity to learn automation, and a
supervisor who has the patience to deal with me getting up to speed!\
