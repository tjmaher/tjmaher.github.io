\-\-- I cannot believe that as of today I have been at Fitbit - Boston
for a whole month! I am a Senior QA Engineer getting ramped up with
Selenium WebDriver / Java development. I have taken many online Selenium
classes with Java and Python. I have spent six or seven months running
automation scripts at my previous position, but this is the first job in
my fifteen year manual software testing career where I am getting paid
to professionally program\... Exactly what I have been looking for! I am
really excited. It is such a great company!\

### What Fitbit - Boston does

<div>

Fitbit - Boston is headquarters of everything that Fitbit does
with eCommerce. Developing the purchasing and order system. Altering and
editing both the shopping cart customers use and the admin functionality
the customer service representatives use.  Verifying that the order
fulfillment process doesn\'t have any hiccups. Tailoring the shopping
cart for each and every country.

Fitbit doesn\'t use off-the-shelf software for their shopping cart.
Everything is tailored specifically for their business. This means that
a QA Engineer has to be aware of every part of creating an order, order
processing, and the shipping process. Whether the Admins can create
promo codes that can be used by our business partners. Whether taxes are
calculated correctly for each state in the United States or every
province in Canada. This means that deadlines are tight, bug fixing is
critical, and testing is automated. And for automation, they use
Selenium WebDriver.\
\
\... And I have never been more happy! I am actually being trained in
automated testing. I thought I was going to have to switch fields in
order to get gainful employment!\
