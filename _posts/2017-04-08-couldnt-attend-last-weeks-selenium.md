Darn it! I can\'t just watch all these videos and take notes on all of
them right now. I have company coming over!\
\
The pulled pork that has been simmering in a crock pot for the past ten
hours.\
The slider buns, cole slaw and corn bread that has been purchased.\
\
\
In preparation for the exciting return of Doctor Who next Saturday, I am
hosting a marathon of five or six episodes at my apartment. After all
the prepwork I am going to be an awful host\...\
\
\... I will be constantly ducking into my office to watch videos!\
\
Happy Testing!\
