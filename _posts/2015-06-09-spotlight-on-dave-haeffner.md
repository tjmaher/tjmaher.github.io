Dave Haeffner has been a big part of the Selenium community ever since
Selenium WebDriver came out. He is a blogger, an author, a teacher, a
consultant, and a lecturer. And most of the information and help he can
give you to learn how to write automated tests in Selenium WebDriver is
free.\

After graduating from Morrisville State, taking various desktop support
positions,  according
to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tourdedave) Dave spent
four-and-a-half years at The Motley Fool, switching from the desktop
support and system administrator field to becoming a quality analyst. By
the time he left The Motley Fool, he had earned a MS in [Management of
Information Technology and worked his way up to a senior role, where he

### The Selenium Hangout

\
Tweeting on the [\@SeleniumHangout](https://twitter.com/SeleniumHangout)
since July 2013, and blogging on
[WordPress](https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/) since August of 2013,
Dave gathers together active members of the Selenium community to form a
virtual Meetup of sorts.\

> **[The World\'s Best Selenium

Dave is the co-founder of the group \-- based on an idea he had at a
Selenium meetup \-- and main organizer.\

### Elemental Selenium

[Elemental Selenium](http://elementalselenium.com/), Dave\'s blog, is a
\"free, once-weekly e-mail on how to use Selenium like a Pro\". It\'s a
very well organized list of automated tips and tricks written in
Selenium with Ruby. All tips have been captured in his [Tips
Archive](http://elementalselenium.com/tips).\

Each tip is labelled whether it is Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced.
They are also classified into categories such as Tools, Testing,
Logging, Design, or Infrastructure.\

### The Selenium Guidebook

The main problem with Selenium WebDriver is that as an open source
product, not only is it missing adequate documentation, but it is
missing adequate documentation that is geared to the testers level.\
\
Before Selenium WebDriver came to be in such demand, us software testers
and QA Engineers were not expected to be coders. (Not sure what a QA
Engineer is? You can read about it in my blog post, [*What is a QA
Engineer?*](http://adventuresinautomation.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-life-of-manual-tester.html))
We were end-user advocates. We sifted through the business requirements,
the designs, and tried to find all the gaps in them while analyzing the
software product, trying to get into our target audience\'s mindset.
With WebDriver, a lot of us needed to learn this new skill set, and
fast, else we were out of a job.\
\
Back in December 2013, written in Ruby, Dave came out with what he
called \"[The Selenium Guidebook](http://seleniumguidebook.com/)\",
which quickly received endorsements from many of the core committers to
the Selenium WebDriver project. Dave tailors this book to us, the QA
Engineer who may be technical, but may be experiencing writing code for
the first time.\
\
\

height="351"}](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c94_5Kl2-NA/VXbRKlYn29I/AAAAAAAAKko/Wzm0Wv-25to/s1600/seleniumguidebook.png)
:::

\
There are three tiers to this guidebook: Just the 92 page eBook in mobi,
ePub, and PDF format along with the source code for the examples; The
Selenium Guidebook with a list of cheat sheets he prepared plus five or
so videos; or the Selenium Guidebook, cheat sheets, and fifteen videos.\
\
And why Ruby? Because most of us QA Engineers are not coders, Dave
believes that because of how software languages such as Ruby handles
most of the complexity for us, Ruby is a better programming language to
use with Selenium than other more complex languages such as Java. Dave
is not in favor of companies using Selenium with Java just because the
company software product is also written in Java.\
\
Luckily for me, as of March of 2015, since Fitbit-Boston\'s automation
department uses Java, Dave came out with a Java version of his Selenium
Guidebook. Even though I had last programmed in Java in grad school ten
years ago, with this book and a few online courses, I have been able to
get up to speed quickly.\
\
If you go to <http://seleniumguidebook.com/>you can request sample
chapters of his book.\
\
Or, if you want to try before you buy, you can go to
[ElementalSelenium.com](http://elementalselenium.com/) or
[SeleniumGuidebook.com](http://seleniumguidebook.com/) and sign up for
his free Selenium Bootcamp. Over a five day period you will receive
emails once a day introducing you to Selenium. The content is culled
from his book and his collection of tips.\
\

### Talks and Lectures

\
Dave is an engaging and humorous speaker, very active in the Selenium
community, travelling to different Meetups across the country. Luckily
for us, we don\'t have to travel to see him. His lectures are posted on
YouTube.\
\
Below is a Webinar in two parts Dave gave recently about Selenium:\
\
**Selenium Test Automation: Practical Tips & Tricks**: (*4/7/2015*)\
*Writeup from The Official Sauce Labs Blog:*\

### Slides on Slideshare

\
With many of his presentations, Dave posts his slides on Slideshare
at <http://www.slideshare.net/tourdedave/presentations>. I have been
enjoying reviewing the slides, trying to backtrack to see if there are
matching YouTube presentation.\

> *\"Dave is an experienced automated tester, and formerly the Senior
> Quality Assurance Analyst at The Motley Fool; responsible for
> creating, implementing, and overseeing their automated web testing
> infrastructure. He was a speaker at Agile 2010 and 2012, is an
> organizer of the DC Selenium meetup, and is an active member in both
> the Selenium and Ruby communities. Dave currently works with a range
> of companies to help improve their quality practices\".*

### The-Internet

Need a playground to write sample Selenium tests? Dave wrote a site
which showcases all the different types of page elements you will find
on the internet. He has dubbed this showcase \"The-Internet\", so, as he
jokes, he can say that he has designed the-internet.\
