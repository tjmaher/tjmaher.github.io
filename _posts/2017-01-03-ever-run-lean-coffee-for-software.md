The Agile End-of-Sprint Retrospective
-------------------------------------

\
My favorite part of the [Agile Software
Development](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/practices-timeline/)
methodology is the [End-Of-Sprint
Retrospective](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/april/key-elements-of-sprint-retrospective).
Every two weeks, the software development gets to come together as a
whole and reflect on just how much they accomplished. During the
meeting, they discuss what went well, what didn\'t go well, what the
team needs to work on.\
\
Everyone gets a voice during the discussion: Not just the product owner.
Not just the developers. Not just the outspoken. Although it may take
some coaxing from a skilled scrum master playing various Agile games,
each individual team member, even the introverted ones, gets a chance to
write down what the group should talk about, after grouping up similar
topics vote on what issues should be discussed, and speak about them.\
**\
Sidenotes:**\
\

-   My favorite Agile game is the Sad, Glad, or Mad game, mentioned
    in Esther Derby\'s [**Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams
    Great**](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649)* (2006)
    (Write on a Post-It Note what made you mad, what made you glad, and
    what made you mad during this past sprint)*.
-   Make sure to begin the retro with the Retrospective Prime Directive
    from Norm Kerth\'s, [**Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team
    Review**](https://www.amazon.com/Project-Retrospectives-Handbook-Team-Reviews/dp/0932633447)
    *(2001)*  \"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly
    believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they
    knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources
    available, and the situation at hand.\"

\
\... I\'ve often wondered if the same methods would work in a
round-table discussion \-- write discussion topics on Post-It Notes,
vote on topics to discuss to get the priority, \"timebox\" them at ten
minutes, then go to the next topic \-- only to find recently that Jim
Benson and Jeremy Lightsmith beat me by six or seven years.\

 The Start of \"Lean Coffee\"
-----------------------------

*\
\"Lean Coffee started in Seattle in 2009. [Jim
Benson](http://twitter.com/ourfounder) and [Jeremy
Lightsmith](http://twitter.com/lightsmith) wanted to start a group that
would discuss Lean techniques in knowledge work -- but didn't want to
start a whole new cumbersome organization with steering committees,
speakers, and such. They wanted a group that did not rely on anything
other than people showing up and wanting to learn or create\"*. -
[LeanCoffee.Org](http://leancoffee.org/)\
\
*\"The Lean Coffee format is both easy to follow and effective at
facilitating learning and collaboration through group discussions.
Although the name combines 'Lean' (eg. Lean Thinking, Lean Startup,
etc.) and 'Coffee' (implying casual morning sessions), neither the
topics nor the meeting times need be so rigid. For instance, I've
attended Lean Coffee meetups held in mornings, afternoons and evenings.
You can gather at a local coffee house, a pub or at your office. Most
successful Lean Coffee groups maintain a reliable cadence, meeting at
the same time and place each week or two\". -*

How About A Software Testing Lean Coffee in Boston?
---------------------------------------------------

\
Stealing the concept from the [Ministry of Testing -
London](https://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub) Meetup, I would like
to run one or two Lean Coffees for the newly re-branded [Ministry of
Testing -
Boston](https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/) and see how
it goes.\
\
What I was thinking of:\
\

-   Find a restaurant that seats 10 or 15 (smaller group to start) in
    Cambridge or Boston
-   Bring along a few pads of Post-It Notes and Sharpies to pass around
    to attendees. 
-   Have guests fill out Post-It Notes loosely related to Software
    Testing or QA
-   Place collected Post-It Notes in a pile saying \"To Discuss\"
-   Read out the topics once to let people hear them, then a second time
    for people to vote on them \-- everyone gets two votes. The Post-It
    Notes are sorted according to priority. 
-   People vote on how long to initially talk about the subject: 5
    minutes or 10 minutes.
-   The discussion begins! Place the topic in a \"Discussing\" pile.
    Start the timer on the phone. People then can vote if they want to
    extend it another five or ten minutes. 
-   Discussion over? Place the topic in the \"Discussed\" pile, and it
    is on to the next topic! Take the next one from the \"To Discuss\"
    pile and repeat the process.

\... Have you ever run a Lean Coffee before? What do you think? Any
pointers?

If you are from the Ministry of Testing - London, I\'d especially love
to hear from you!
