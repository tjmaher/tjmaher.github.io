\
From 6:00 pm to 6:30 pm, members can gather. The talk should begin at

\
**About the Speaker:**\
\
\"Moshe brings over 15 years of experience in leadership, engineering
and operational roles in public and private companies. Prior to founding
Applitools, Moshe held leadership roles at Wave Systems Corp., Safend,
Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) and Sat-Smart Ltd. Moshe holds a Bachelor's degree
in Information Systems from the Technion Israel's Institute of
Technology and MBA from IDC (Wharton Business School GCP program)\"\
\
\
**About Applitools:**\
\
\"Applitools was founded by software developers on a mission to shorten
the release cycles of their product. Despite having good unit test
coverage and automated end-to-end functional tests, a full manual
regression of the UI, covering multiple operating systems, web browsers,
screen resolutions and localizations, took days to complete.\
\
\"Back at the time, there were plenty of excellent commercial and
open-source tools that allowed you to test the functionality of your app
through the UI, but there were no tools that allowed you to
automatically test the look & feel and user experience of your app. That
is, verifying that each UI element in each page appears in the right
color, shape, position and size, and that it does not overlap or hide
other UI elements.\
\
\"After years of hard work carried out by experts, we successfully built
a vast tech-stack that solved the automated visual testing problem\".
