### New Blog Entries! 

Mid-January 2018, I start a new job as a Software Development Engineer
in Test:
An [SDET](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2004/05/06/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-sdet-software-development-engineer-in-test-in-exchange/) role
at a [security company](http://threatstack.com/), tackling brave new
technologies \-- some I\'ve only tinkered with, some which are brand-new
to me.\
\
I have done API testing before, using [Apache Http
Components](http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/coming-up-how-to-work-with-rest-apis.html), [Rest
Assured](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/02/are-you-sure-bus-line-still-listed.html),
and [Twitter4J](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/10/tinkering-with-twitter-1.html).
Most of these have been in Java, though. Although I have tinkered
with [Docker](http://www.tjmaher.com/search?q=docker) and [Vagrant](http://www.tjmaher.com/search?q=vagrant),
I have never
used [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) tools such
as [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/) or [Kitchen](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html).
And I have never
used [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) or [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),
two of the primary coding languages they will be using.\
\
\... I made sure to tell my future employer all of this \-- I am nothing
if not brutally honest on job interviews. They hired me anyway, saying
they would provide plenty of on-the-job training. Not wanting to
embarrass myself, I\'ve started to hit the books. There are plenty of
resources
on [Scala](http://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started.html), [Chef](https://learn.chef.io/),
and even the [API ](https://app.threatstack.com/api/docs/)of [the
product I will be
testing](https://threatstack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000374184-Getting-Started).\
\
Expect many more blog entries on these subjects in the coming months as
I do some extra-curricular learnin\'.\

###  New Speaking Engagements! 

I am a speaker at Joe Colantonio\'s [Automation Guild
2018](http://automationguild.com/), and will be giving a live Q & A
session January 10th, 2018 at 11 AM.\
