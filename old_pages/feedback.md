# Feedback

I have been trying to switch from being a manual QA Engineer to an
automated tester for years. Back in March 2015, finally, I found a
position at Fitbit-Boston! With the new job, I had been trying to
capture as much knowledge as possible. Blogging about what I was
learning, I found, to helped stick the information in my head. I've
done it ever since.

Here are some kind words I have seen around the internet, referring to
this blog:

**[Angie Jones](https://angiejones.tech/)**, SDET at Twitter, during her
talk "[How to Become an Automation Engineer](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/1079399747834113027)"
when she mentions automation gurus to follow on Twitter (12/11/2017)

"T.J\... T.J. is very interesting, especially for people who are new
and trying to transition into automation. He did manual testing for
about twenty years, and then he transitioned into automation, and so
he's been learning a lot on his own.  

"What's great about T.J. is that he documents all of these things
that he's learning. And he has a web site. And he goes step-by-step
on 'Okay, I'm picking up this new tool or this new technique, and
here are things you can learn about it' ... So... things that I
haven't used before, I can go to T.J.'s site and learn from him". 

**Alex McPeak**, in the article \"[Expert Insight: Why Testing
Matters](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/test-automation/expert-insight-testing-matters/)"
on the CrossBrowserTesting.com, quoted a story I relayed to them
(12/11/2017):

"The team developing a new European Union shopping cart found out
quickly that the VAT tax test server was flaky. But was that the cause
of the one-cent discrepancy between the estimated and actual price
that randomly appeared? Everyone on the team thought so. I wasn't
sure. 

"Taking my Selenium script that placed an EU order, I looped it
twenty times, collecting data all the while. It had a failure rate of
40 -- 60%. After showing the metrics gathered to the new developer
assigned to the EU cart, he checked his code. It turned out he had
made a rounding error calculating the estimated and actual tax
differently. 

"Does something not feel right? Don't just go with a hunch or a gut
feeling. Make sure to do the legwork required."

2017](https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2017/09/30-must-read-small-business-it-blogs-2017)\"
(9/30/2017):

"The best IT blogs are sometimes written by people you may have never
heard of but who know a great deal about a particular technology. Such
 is the case with the blog written by T.J. Maher, who has worked in the
 software testing field since 1996. Maher started Adventures in
 Automation in 2015 as a way to store the \'copious amounts\' of notes
 he found himself taking when he began researching automation
 development. The blog covers a wide range of software testing topics,
 from automated testing frameworks to quality assurance. Although this
 blog is highly specialized, it should appeal to anyone who works in
 software testing".

**Mark Winteringham** (aka 2bittester) on his blog [MW Test
Consultancy](http://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/) used [a blog article I
wrote](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/08/need-your-expert-opinion-for-article.html)
to add to the virtual conversation I started with "[Code coverage and
automated checks: Is 100% coverage
enough?](http://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/code-coverage/)"
(8/21/2017)\

"Recently [TJ
Maher](http://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/code-coverage/www.tjmaher.com)
 ([\@tjmaher1](https://twitter.com/tjmaher1)) posted some great
 questions [in his
 article](http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/08/need-your-expert-opinion-for-article.html)
 "Are unit tests and 100% code coverage enough?". Questions that we
 should be asking ourselves in regards to Continuous Development and
 DevOps. There was one question that jumped out at me. And it's a
 question I find myself challenging a lot when it comes to automated
 checking.

'Do you think 100% code coverage of unit tests and integration tests
 is enough in environments using Continuous Deployment? What do you use
 as supplements in your testing efforts?'

"The discussion and pursuit of 100% code coverage with automated
 checks are nothing new. But, as continuous deployment's goal is to
 enable teams to release regular, small releases and adopting a testing
 first culture. And Automated checks have taken on a more vital role.
 It's important to scrutinise automated checks more and ask: 

"What is the role of automated checks in helping us understand what
 sort of product we are actually releasing? What are the weaknesses of
 automated checks? \[\...\]\" *[Read

(July 7, 2017)

"[]...] I continually try to seek out practitioners that I can
 learn from. When I see an expert, I look to see if they have left a
 trail of evidence that I can study and learn from. I don't just want
 their conclusions, I also want to see their working, as I can learn
 from that.

"Recently I've been following the work of the following practitioners
 on GitHub because they are leaving a trail of evidence that I can
 learn from: [Bas Djikstra](http://www.ontestautomation.com/), [Mark
 Winteringham](http://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/), [Angie
 Jones](https://angiejones.tech/), [TJ
 Maher](http://www.tjmaher.com/) ...
 "I like to find practitioners who are leaving a trail of 'working',
 not just explained results, but processes, code, 'doing' videos, case
 studies. I think this add longer term study value than an outcome
 report.

"And study their work because they may be working at an aspirational
 level - a level of competence that you have not yet achieved, but they
demonstrate the possibility of achievement and you can learn from them
 to build the skill to do what they do, or take a different
 implementation path after learning from their experience (a path you
 then document for future practitioners)".


**[Alex McPeak](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/author/alex-mcpeak/)**,
"[What's the Best Programming Language to Learn First? It
Depends](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/development/best-programming-language-to-learn-first/)\"
from the CrossBrowserTesting Blog (April 18, 2017)\

"[...] Especially for testers, as the QA industry begins to
 increasingly require skills in automation, programming knowledge
 becomes an invaluable asset. In \'[Coding is key to a test automation
 career: Are you
 prepared?](https://techbeacon.com/coding-key-test-automation-career-are-you-prepared#disqus_thread)\' T.J.
 Maher advances that learning to code is the number one way to break
into test automation. Then, even after you think you understand it,
 you need to continue practicing all the time. 

" 'The most important thing is not to stop practicing to code once
 you're hired as a test automation engineer,\' said Maher. \'Learning
 is a never-ending journey.' "

 "Thomas F. Maher, Jr has been a Software Quality Assurance Engineer
 for over fifteen years, and is attempting to make the leap from manual
 to automated testing. Recently, he posted an article to his Adventures
 in Automation blog in which he discusses the evolving role of QA
Engineers---an evolution that directly relates to the increasing speed
 of software projects. 

"Test automation dominates the industry, and as a result, many may
 question the necessity of QA Engineers: "If you can replace some of
 the tasks a QA Engineer does, why not replace all of them?"* 

"Maher Jr notes that his organization maintains a healthy mix of both
 manual and automated QA, an ideal structure in his opinion. Read his
 [article](https://www.tjmaher.com/2015/09/are-qa-engineers-becoming-extinct.html)
  for a closer look at the shifting role of QA Engineers and then
 decide for yourself: are QA Engineers really going extinct?"
