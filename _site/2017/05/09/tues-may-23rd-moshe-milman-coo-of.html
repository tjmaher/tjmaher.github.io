Moshe holds a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems from the Technion Israel’s Institute of Technology and MBA from IDC (Wharton Business School GCP program)" <br /><br /><br /><b>About Applitools:</b><br /><br />"Applitools was founded by software developers on a mission to shorten the release cycles of their product. Despite having good unit test coverage and automated end-to-end functional tests, a full manual regression of the UI, covering multiple operating systems, web browsers, screen resolutions and localizations, took days to complete.<br /><br />"Back at the time, there were plenty of excellent commercial and open-source tools that allowed you to test the functionality of your app through the UI, but there were no tools that allowed you to automatically test the look &amp; feel and user experience of your app. That is, verifying that each UI element in each page appears in the right color, shape, position and size, and that it does not overlap or hide other UI elements.<br /><br />"After years of hard work carried out by experts, we successfully built a vast tech-stack that solved the automated visual testing problem". -<a href="https://applitools.com/about">Applitools.com, About</a><br /><br />If you wish to attend, sign up at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/239823300/" target="_blank">https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/239823300/</a><br /><br /><b>Videos&nbsp;</b><br /><br />Here, Moshe Milman is giving a walkthrough of an earlier version of his project... <br /><br /><b>Intro to Automated Visual Testing &amp; Applitools Eyes</b> <br />Moshe Milman, co-founder of Applitools, Sept 2014<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ngBi-xZ1NiA" width="560"></iframe><br /><i><a href="https://youtu.be/ngBi-xZ1NiA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/ngBi-xZ1NiA</a></i><br /><br /><br />If you missed Brian Jordan, formerly of Code.org, in our last talk, here is a short demo of him talking about Applitools... <br /><br /><br /><b>Code.org uses visual testing to optimize continuous delivery (video case study)</b><br />June 2016<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xaAmF3U4JvM" width="560"></iframe><br /><i><a href="https://youtu.be/xaAmF3U4JvM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/xaAmF3U4JvM</a></i><br /><br />Joe Colantonio gives a walkthrough of how to set up Applitools...<br /><br /><br /><b>Applitools - How to Get Started with Visual Validation Testing</b><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KOdQAyDIvJI" width="560"></iframe><br /><i><a href="https://youtu.be/KOdQAyDIvJI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/KOdQAyDIvJI</a></i><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
