Are You a Recruiting Company or Placement Firm in the Boston or Cambridge, MA area? Are you having trouble finding software testing candidates to meet the needs of your clients? Have you ever thought about hosting a Meetup event at your place of business, educating software testers on how to keep up with the ever changing software industry and sharing your knowledge ?<br /><br />A newly rebranded Meetup group of software testers,&nbsp;<b>The Ministry of Testing - Boston</b>, has just been formed, with the Greater Boston QA and Testing Meetup moving under the umbrella of the <b>Ministry of Testing</b>, a UK-based software testing community. We are looking to place new events on our event calendar for our <i>almost four hundred person strong</i>&nbsp;Meetup.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wsgD9bwYoC8/WH-ZAhgr6fI/AAAAAAAALkU/ZNS-Z62ds34oDjlttFJRgs9ZpZnL5RPJACLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-01-18%2Bat%2B11.32.48%2BAM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="193" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wsgD9bwYoC8/WH-ZAhgr6fI/AAAAAAAALkU/ZNS-Z62ds34oDjlttFJRgs9ZpZnL5RPJACLcB/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-01-18%2Bat%2B11.32.48%2BAM.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Formerly the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/" target="_blank">Greater Boston QA and Testing</a> Meetup</i></td></tr></tbody></table><b>Ministry of Testing - Boston </b>website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/" target="_blank">https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/</a><br /><b>Ministry of Testing</b>: <a href="http://www.ministryoftesting.com/" target="_blank">http://www.ministryoftesting.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Imagine an event where your recruiters could give the "inside scoop" on how software testers adjust their skill set to meet the needs of today's job market, navigating these uncertain times.<br /><br />Imagine establishing a relationship with thirty or so future candidates for software testing positions as you answer difficult questions such as:<br /><br /><ul><li>Is there hope for traditional manual tester without a coding background to get placed in a perm or contract position?</li><li>What tools and technologies does your company forecast to be in hot demand in 2017?</li><li>What is the best strategy for potential candidates to get themselves ready for automation development positions?</li><li>What do you look for in a resume?</li><li>How do you pitch candidates to clients who may not be an exact match?</li><li>Do coding bootcamps even help QA Engineers? If so, which ones?&nbsp;</li><li>What are the difference qualifications needed between a mid-level QA Engineer, a Senior QA Engineer, and a Software Engineer in Test?</li><li>What qualifications does it take to be a QA Lead or a QA Manager?</li></ul><br />This could be all addressed in one Meetup event or a series of Meetup events.<br /><br />... And, of course, members would be encouraged to bring their resume.<br /><br />Interested?
