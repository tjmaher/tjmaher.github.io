Any QA Engineers in the Boston area? Come join the new Ministry of Testing: Boston group as we hold a roundtable discussion at an actual round table, at John Harvard's Brewpub in Cambridge, MA. I'll be next door before the Meetup if anyone wants to chat beforehand. <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"T.J.
