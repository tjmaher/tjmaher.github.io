Wow, this is the 200th post I have written here on Adventures in Automation.<br /><br />This blog started a bit over two years ago. As I was trying to do one last big push to try to (somehow) make the shift from manual to automated testing, my wife suggested that instead of the many research notes I was compiling stay on my computer, why not share them in a blog?<br /><br />It was a fabulous suggestion! Not only did I have a code portfolio <a href="https://github.com/tjmaher" target="_blank">on GitHub</a> that employers could view, they also received a walkthrough of the code with my blog from automating a simple site <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/06/simple-manipulation-of-login-page.html" target="_blank">covering basic concepts</a>, to building a test framework <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/12/next-week-automating-amazon-how-i-am.html" target="_blank">for more complex sites</a>&nbsp;and testing <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/coming-up-how-to-work-with-rest-apis.html" target="_blank">more complex APIs</a>.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />It's still a mad scramble for me; I've only been coding on-the-job for the past two years.<br /><br />Right now, I am attempting to figure out how to assemble a mobile testing framework with <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/03/serenity-bdd-automation-framework-that.html" target="_blank">Serenity BDD </a>to handle tests and reports, and <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AdventuresInAutomation/~3/72yd8xG9wd4/learning-appium-what-is-appium-server.html" target="_blank">Appium</a> to handle mobile automation.<br /><br />I have to say, thank you, dear reader, for all of your support over the past two years.<br /><br />And, by the way .... Happy Testing!<br /><br />-T.J.
