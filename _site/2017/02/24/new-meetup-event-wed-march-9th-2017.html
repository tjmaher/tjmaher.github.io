They used to be an hour. Then <a href="http://www.labnol.org/tech/ted-talk-18-minutes/12755/">TED went to 20 minutes</a>, <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/">Pecha Kucha to 6</a>, and <a href="http://www.igniteseattle.com/">Ignite to 5</a>. The <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/14/presentations-pecha-kucha-technology-breakthroughs-oreilly.html">trend of short presentations has been on the rise for years</a> and one wonders where it will stop.<br /><br />"But then consider TV advertisements: they’re 30 seconds long. The good ones communicate many ideas well in a very short amount of time.<br /><br />“Years ago I ran an event at Microsoft called Design Day. Each year we’d experiment with different formats and one year we tried 99 second presentations. It went well and we did it the next year too. Unlike most speaking events it gives the audience a real chance to participate.<br /><br />“ [...] It’s a small commitment to get someone to speak for less than 2 minutes. They can practice their material 10 times in half an hour. The surprise of short format speaking is it forces speakers to get to the good stuff”.&nbsp;</i></div><div><i><br /></i><h2>About iZotope:&nbsp;</h2></div><div>From their site:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/company/about-us.html">https://www.izotope.com/en/company/about-us.html</a><br /><i><br />“iZotope makes innovative products that inspire and enable people to be creative.
