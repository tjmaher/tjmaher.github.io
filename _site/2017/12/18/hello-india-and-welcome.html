Namaste! Hello, India!&nbsp;Welcome to this blog! I'd offer you tea or a mango lassi but you can't yet attach a beverage to a blog post.<br /><br />I'd also translate this page to your native tongue but I don't know Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Meitei, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, or Urdu... so English will have to do.<br /><br />I was checking Google Analytics and saw that I had over 800 unique visitors to this site from your country in November 2017 alone.<br /><br />Although I started this blog almost three years ago as my own private online collection of research notes, I get next to no feedback.<br /><br />... Actually, that's not true. The bot that advertises Testing Jobs in Chennai always leaves messages in the comments section. It thinks this site is very helpful.<br /><br />How did you stumble on this blog? What do you like about it? I hope it is useful to you. Is there anything I can help you with? Do you have any doubts? Let me know in the Comments section below, or follow me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/tjmaher1" target="_blank">@tjmaher1</a> and say hello!<br /><br />Happy Testing! Go Team India! Go Men in Blue! Go&nbsp;Virat Kohli!<br /><br />-T.J.
