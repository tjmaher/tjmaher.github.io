Thank you so much for setting up the event, along with the the refreshments, Lindsay!<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>About the The Digital Quality Handbook:</h3><br /><div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0692885994/" target="_blank">According to Amazon</a>:<br />"As mobile and web technologies continue to expand and basically drives large organizational business in virtually every vertical or industry, it is critical to understand how to take existing release practices for mobile and web apps to the next level, including software development life cycle (SDLC), tools, quality, etc. Organizations which are already enjoying the power of digital are still struggling with various challenges that can be related to many factors, such as:<br /><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="more"></a><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />• "SDLC and processes maturity<br />• "Expanding test coverage to include more non-functional testing, user condition testing, etc.<br />• "Coping with existing limitations of open source tools and frameworks<br />• "Sustaining correctly sized and up-to-date mobile test labs<br />• "Getting proper quality insights upon each test cycle prior and post production<br />• "Branching wisely cross-platform and cross-feature test suites<br /><br />"The issues above are just a few out of probably many others existing today. However, this book tackles those and provide working best practices to overcome them. Each chapter in this book addresses a key challenge and provides practical examples and real life 'recipes' to overcome the difficulties and eventually help other organizations who might be facing the same difficulties".<br /><br /><h3>About the Talk:</h3>Eran was fresh off of the <a href="https://stareast.techwell.com/">STAR East software testing conference</a> in Orlando, Florida, his previous stop on his book tour.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="485" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/MHdHfUoMsLmYjX" style="border-width: 1px; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" width="595"> </iframe> <br /><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ek121268/digital-quality-handbook-meetup-presentation" target="_blank" title="Digital quality handbook meetup presentation">Digital quality handbook meetup presentation</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ek121268" target="_blank">Perfecto Mobile</a></strong> </div><br />Eran Kinsbruner, (&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ek121268">@ek121268</a>&nbsp;), Blogger&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.perfectomobile.com/author/ek121268/">for Perfecto Mobile</a>, has been kicking around the idea of writing a book for a while.

Fragmentation in the industry made it difficult to test. Which version were you testing with? You really needed to understand how each version behaved.<br /><br />... Eran filed a patent for mobile automating digital j2me.<br /><br /><h3>How Do You Mix and Match Newer Features with Newer Tests?&nbsp;</h3><br />Eran demoed what is known as "the long press". Hold your finger over an icon, pressing it for an extended period, and new functionality can happen … but this feature is only in Android 7.0 and newer. In Android 6.1 they don’t have that feature. How do you connect device, application, and supported features with the proper testplan?<br /><br />Eran described one way to do it:<br /><br /><ul><li>ADB, the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html" target="_blank">Android Debug Bridge</a>, can runs a scan to see what features are listed in a place, such as a <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html" target="_blank">manifest file</a>, then use that to piece together what test plans we need.</li><li>This branching can become a becoming a problem. You need a technology to smartly branch the right features to the right devices.</li></ul><br /><br /><h3>How Do You Decide On What Browsers to Use</h3>How much digital test coverage do you actually need? Which are the right browsers and platforms? In Eran's article&nbsp;<a href="https://www.utest.com/articles/what-you-need-to-know-when-planning-your-test-lab-in-2017" target="_blank">What You Need To Know When Planning Your Test Lab in 2017</a>&nbsp;covers that, how he advises&nbsp;companies in setting up a mobile and web testing suite. <br /><br /><h3>How Does Perfecto Handle Automated Testing?&nbsp;</h3><br />Eran talked a bit about how Perfect handles automated testing. He tries to set up as much of a real world environment as possible: If you do not have automated tests set up a real environment, in a real world environment, you are just guessing.<br /><br />This is why they use at Perfecto the concept of "personas":<br /><br /><ul><li>Let’s say that you have  a customer archetype, let's dub her "Georgia", who is a super user. You can map her to use cases the User Experience team has come up with. Keep her stats in a JSON file. How many devices does she have? What is she running in the background? What network? How is the latency? What phone iPhone 6?</li></ul><br />Perfecto takes this data and put it through what they call a “Wind Tunnel”.
