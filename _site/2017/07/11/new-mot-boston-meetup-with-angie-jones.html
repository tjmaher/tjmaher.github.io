Right now, I am heading to another Ministry of Testing - Boston meetup. Tonight's special guest will be Angie Jones!<br /><div><br /></div><div>Like a director hosting a Q &amp; A session at a film festival after a movie has been screened, after watching her April 2017 "The Build That Cried Broken" http://youtu.be/VotJqV4n8ig Angie Jones, newly employed at Twitter, will be giving a talk via webconference.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We have 20 people signed up. I hope at least 15 show!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I swear, we have four hundred new members since January 2017 (700 total) and only ten might show on average. I wonder if it is the location, if iZotope or Cengage Learning are too out of the way?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I have an enormous bag of swag to give away. SmartBear hoodies, pens and stickers. Sauce Labs T-Shirts and bike reflectors. Ministry of Testing stickers and pins. I just have more swag than attendees!</div><div><br /></div><div>It was a good day today. I gave an hour presentation and demo on this Summer's Appiuum projects. I think it went well!</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's hoping!</div><div><br /></div>-T.J.
