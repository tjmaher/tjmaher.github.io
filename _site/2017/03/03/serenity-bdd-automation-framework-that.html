When someone is demoing a new automation toolset for the very first time, so many questions in my mind start bubbling to to the surface:<br /><ul><li>This is an open-source tool? What grad student created it? What was the student attempting to achieve with this tool? What problems were they trying to solve?</li><li>Is the tool on GitHub? Unit tests and code samples provided for us novices learning the tool?&nbsp;</li><li>What company supports it and sponsors it? Is the tool popular enough for a community to have built itself around the tool?&nbsp;</li><li>Is the tool still being maintained? When was the last time code was checked into the GitHub repository? How many are watching and have starred the GitHub repository?</li></ul><div>Although the contract position I start on Monday, begins as a manual testing position -- the best way to learn the system under test -- it'll move to an automation position using the tool&nbsp;<b>Serenity BDD</b>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Note: BDD stands for Behavior Driven Development.

Is the automation code DRY (<i>Don't Repeat Yourself</i>), is it easy to maintain, and is it readable? How is the automation framework structured, is the architecture as good as it could be?<br /><br />Most of the software development team, though, are <b><i>not</i></b> coders. How can you show the business analysts, the product owners about what the tests actually do, and what it means when the tests pass or fail?<br /><br />John Ferguson Smart's solution was to use <b>Specification By Example</b>.<br /><br /><div><h2>What Is Specification By Example?</h2><div><br /></div><div>Specification by example is&nbsp;a subject we have talked about in this blog back in January, mentioned by Agile Coach&nbsp;<b>Greg Tutunjian</b>&nbsp;when he&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/01/test-automation-and-specification-by.html" target="_blank">spoke at a Ministry of Testing - Boston Meetup</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Greg&nbsp;Tutunjian, <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/01/test-automation-and-specification-by.html" target="_blank">during his talk</a>,<b>&nbsp;</b>defined&nbsp;<b>Specification by Example</b>: (SBE) as "A collaboration method for specifying requirements and tests, Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD)".&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The term was first seen in&nbsp;Martin Fowler's blog&nbsp;<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SpecificationByExample.html">SpecificationByExample</a>&nbsp;dated March 2004,&nbsp;</div><div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"I was attending a workshop at XP/Agile Universe in 2002 when the phrase 'Specification By Example' struck me as a way to describe one of roles of testing in&nbsp;<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html#xp">XP</a>&nbsp;[...]<br />"Specification By Example isn't the way most of us have been brought up to think of specifications. Specifications are supposed to be general, to cover all cases. Examples only highlight a few points, you have to infer the generalizations yourself. This does mean that Specification By Example can't be the only requirements technique you use, but it doesn't mean that it can't take a leading role.<br />"[...] One of the great things about specification by example is that examples are usually much easier to come up with, particularly for the non-nerds who we write the software for".</i></blockquote></div><div><br /></div><h2>What Is Serenity BDD?</h2><div><br />Originally called Thucydides, named after the Ancient Greek historian who wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-Peloponnesian-War-Thucydides/dp/0140440399">History of the Peloponnesian War</a>, Serenity BDD is an integrated test automation framework. From <a href="http://serenity-bdd.info/docs/serenity/" target="_blank">The Serenity Reference Manual, Introduction</a>:</div><div><br /></div><div><i>"Serenity BDD is an open source library that aims to make the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example">living documentation</a> a reality.<br /><br />"Serenity BDD helps you write cleaner and more maintainable automated acceptance and regression tests faster. Serenity also uses the test results to produce illustrated, narrative reports that document and describe what your application does and how it works. Serenity tells you not only what tests have been executed, but more importantly, what requirements have been tested.<br /><br />"One key advantage of using Serenity BDD is that you do not have to invest time in building and maintaining your own automation framework.<br /><br />"Serenity BDD provides strong support for automated web tests using <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver">Selenium 2</a>, though it also works very effectively for non-web tests such as tests that exercise web services or even call application code directly.<br /><br />"The aim of Serenity is to make it easy to quickly write well-structured, maintainable automated acceptance criteria, using your favorite BDD or conventional testing library. You can work with Behavior-Driven-Development tools like Cucumber or JBehave, or simply use JUnit. You can integrate with requirements stored in an external source (such as JIRA or any other test cases management tool), or just use a simple directory-based approach to organize your requirements".</i></div><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bkrK9r2bG1M/WLia3L590xI/AAAAAAAALp4/q990RYKc9q8CpCx0-2mpGX8ggqJcYxtJwCLcB/s1600/basic-concepts-detailed-test-count.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bkrK9r2bG1M/WLia3L590xI/AAAAAAAALp4/q990RYKc9q8CpCx0-2mpGX8ggqJcYxtJwCLcB/s640/basic-concepts-detailed-test-count.png" width="527" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Screenshot used in the <a href="http://serenity-bdd.info/docs/serenity/" target="_blank">Serenity Reference Guide</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h2>Serenity BDD Demo:</h2><br /><b>Serenity BDD - Tutorial 1</b><br />John Ferguson Smart, May 2016 <br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-6CcDFn5Ug" width="560"></iframe> <br /><br /><br /><b>Serenity BDD Tutorial #2 - Introducing Screenplay</b><br />John Ferguson Smart, <i>May 2016</i><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_1i_oU2H3gQ" width="560"></iframe> <br /><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>What is the ScreenPlay Pattern?</h2><br />From "<a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/Beyond-Page-Objects-Test-Automation-Serenity-Screenplay" target="_blank">Beyond Page Objects: Next Generation Test Automation with Serenity and the Screenplay Pattern</a>" by John Ferguson Smart (March 2016)<br /><br /><i>"The Screenplay Pattern (formerly known as <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/RiverGlide/a-journey-beyond-the-page-object-pattern">the J</a><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/RiverGlide/a-journey-beyond-the-page-object-pattern">ourney Pattern</a>) is the application of SOLID design principles to automated acceptance testing, and helps teams address these issues. It is essentially what would result from the merciless refactoring of Page Objects using SOLID design principles. It was first devised by Antony Marcano between 2007 - 2008, refined with thinking from Andy Palmer from 2009. It didnâ€™t receive the name 'the Journey Pattern' until Jan Molak started working with it in 2013. Several people have written about it under this name already, however, the authors now refer to it as the Screenplay Pattern.<br /><br />"The Screenplay Pattern is an approach to writing high quality automated acceptance tests based on good software engineering principles such as the <a href="http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">Single Responsibility Principle</a>, and the <a href="http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">Open-Closed Principle</a>. It favours composition over inheritance, and employs thinking from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454881151&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=domain+driven+design">Domain Driven Design</a> to reflect the domain of performing acceptance tests, steering you towards the effective use of layers of abstraction.
