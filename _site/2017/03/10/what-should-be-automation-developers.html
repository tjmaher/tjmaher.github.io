I have a question for all the automation developers in the audience:<br /><br />Let's say you have a manual tester who wishes to become an automation developer. What is the first language you would advise that the manual tester learn?&nbsp;&nbsp;Java? JavaScript? Python? Ruby? Or does it not really matter?<br /><br />When someone asks me, I usually say: Java or JavaScript. It feel like those are the most in demand here in the Boston job market when it comes to automation.<br /><br />Why do I say Java? Because, well, I am probably biased. It's my favorite language. It's the one I studied in grad school. It's the one in which I have two years of work experience. And it is the one I feel is in the most in demand. Studying it gives you good, solid Object Oriented Programming. It may have the hardest learning curve, but I think it is worth it. Work through Alan Richardson's Java for Testers. Purchase Alan's course, Selenium WebDriver with Java. Start reading classic software design books such as Robert C. Martin's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445" target="_blank">Agile Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices</a>, and his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" target="_blank">Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Craftmanship</a>. Or Martin Fowler's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672" target="_blank">Refactoring</a>: Improving the Design of Existing Code. You will become well-versed not just in automation, but in software development.<br /><br />Why do I say JavaScript? So many web-based front ends are being developed in JavaScript such as AngularJS and ViewJS, and web apps that are in Node.JS. Automation developers are pairing these web apps with frameworks that are also in JavaScript. See my blog post <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/10/learning-javascript.html" target="_blank">Learning JavaScript</a> to see links I have collected.<br /><br />I attempted to make the case on Tuesday to the other Ministry of Testing - Boston members that Java was good because it was more difficult than Python and Ruby... and it wasn't until I expressed it with the other members that I realized how daft I sounded.<br /><br />They saw my point... but the problem was that I didn't realize was that if someone wants to start learning coding on their own, it might be best to pick languages such as Python or Ruby which might not have such a steep learning curve.<br /><br />So, what do you think? :) Please vote, below!<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">A manual tester wants to learn automated testing.
