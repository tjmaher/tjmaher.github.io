What I didn't know was that OWASP had formed a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/owaspboston/" target="_blank">Meetup group</a> last year that has met every few months at Akamai Technologies starting in March of 2014.<br /><br />OWASP - Boston is planning on holding regular meetings on the first Wednesday of every month.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><h3>Past OWASP Meetups</h3>Past meetups of the OWASP Group -- according to their Meetup site -- have been:<br /><ul><li>Training sessions on SQL injection (<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_SQL_Injection_(OTG-INPVAL-005)" target="_blank">SQLi</a>) and using <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Webgoat" target="_blank">WebGoat</a> &nbsp;to understand vulnerabilities in J2EE and ASP.Net applications. &nbsp;( <a href="http://www.meetup.com/owaspboston/events/165671802/" target="_blank">Meetup link</a> &nbsp;)</li><li>Training sessions on exploring the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ZAP" target="_blank">ZAP</a>&nbsp;) ( <a href="http://www.meetup.com/owaspboston/events/185676452/" target="_blank">Meetup link</a> &nbsp;)&nbsp;</li><li>Using <a href="https://github.com/nVisium/xssValidator" target="_blank">xssValidator</a> &nbsp;-- an extension of <a href="http://portswigger.net/burp/proxy.html" target="_blank">Burp Proxy</a>&nbsp;-- to automate testing for Cross Site Scripting (<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS" target="_blank">XSS</a>&nbsp;) errors.

Out of every purchase, $1.50 is donated to OWASP, a non-profit organization.&nbsp;</li></ul><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BiRinGbSTrg/VUvne5ymVRI/AAAAAAAAKiQ/w-Yw9z3BGVU/s1600/15012864259_e2d5d4a87b_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BiRinGbSTrg/VUvne5ymVRI/AAAAAAAAKiQ/w-Yw9z3BGVU/s640/15012864259_e2d5d4a87b_o.jpg" width="380" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Image from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/apolloclark/15012864259/in/set-72157647443026132" target="_blank">Apollo Clark's Flikr</a> site</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><ul><li><b>New Meetup Locations</b>: Along with meeting at Akamai for Cambridge / Boston area people, Constant Contact in Waltham has offered to sponsor Meetups so people near Route 128 can get involved with OWASP.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><b>Outreach programs</b>: OWASP is reaching out to the community, with groups as various as software quality folks, ISO (International Organization for Standardization) groups and college students so that security standards can be introduced before they are ever needed. Jim is also looking for speakers. Have a five or ten minute talk? Volunteer to become a speaker at an OWASP meeting. Whether it is an informal talk or Powerpoint slide, the important thing is, as Jim said, "Any transmission of knowledge is useful".&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Announcements from Roy Watterson</h3>Roy Watterson, the co-founder of the OWASP Boston Meetup, stood up and spoke briefly about how to keep in touch with what OWASP Boston is doing:<br /><br /><ul><li>OWASP Boston Chapter: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston</li><li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/OWASPBOSTON" target="_blank">@OWASPBOSTON</a>&nbsp;</li><li>OWASP Boston Meetup: http://www.meetup.com/owaspboston/</li></ul><br />Roy went around the room, asking if there were any other announcements:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>New Security Meetup</b>: Apollo Clark mentioned about how he started a new Meetup, the &nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Kali-Linux-Users" target="_blank">Boston Kali Linux Users Meetup</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>New Jobs Available</b>: Many companies are hiring, looking for security testers.

He is currently the Content Manager for the Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) and has actively advocated for the evolution of VDBs for many years. His work in the vulnerability disclosure process has included seeking new vulnerabilities, writing advisories, coordinating disclosure and working with several organizations, helping them to improve their vulnerability handling and response. Martin is also a member of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Editorial Board.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Co-hosting the presentation with Martin, Christey is a Principal Information Security Engineer in the Security and Information Operations Division of The MITRE Corporation. Christey also serves as the editor of the CVE list as well as being the Chair of the CVE Editorial Board. He has been a contributor to vulnerability studies and was co-author of the influential “Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Process” IETF draft of 2002. His focus of late has revolved around secure software development and testing, consumer-friendly software security metrics, the theoretical underpinnings of vulnerabilities, and vulnerability research". - <a href="http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/07/24/vulnerability-statistics-suck/" target="_blank">Alan McStravick</a>&nbsp;</blockquote><div><h3>Crowdsource Your Security Testing with Bugcrowd</h3><div style="text-align: left;">For the next section, Leif Dreizler from Bugcrowd talked about Bugcrowd, and its success in crowdsourcing security testing.
