<span style="font-family: inherit;">When I started my Freshman year at Bridgewater State back on September 1990 as an eager Computer Science major and computer lab aide, there were two main platforms that were popular at the time: MS-DOS and Digital Equipment Corps VAX / VMS system, both which used a command line inteface (CLI).&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />What did they look like?</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">The screens had a black background.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Green, amber, or white were the font colors.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Open up the Terminal on your Mac or Powershell on the PC, maximize the window to fill the screen, and that is exactly what it was like.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"></span><br /><a name='more'></a><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />When I was a computer lab aide, I trained new students using WordPerfect for MS-DOS, the word processing program we were using at the time.&nbsp;As clunky as Windows 3.1 was when it came out, I thought it was a great improvement over the environment we had been using. And when I found a student job as desktop publisher / graphic artist at the Alumni Center, and I was able to use a Mac Classic loaded with an early version of Adobe Photoshop, I thought it was even better. I even loved my Windows programming class, making a Dungeons and Dragons like game in the style of Phantasy Star. Once I started using a GUI, I avoided the CLI whenever possible. When the situation called for it at work, I knew the basics such as&nbsp;<i>cd</i>,<i> mkdir</i>, <i>ls</i>, etc, but I never became that experienced with Unix or Linux.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Recently, I have been brushing up on my CLI skills as part of my quest to turn myself from a manual tester who can code a bit to being a Software Engineer in Test. It has certainly takes me back to those early days!</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;">Not familiar with the Command Line?&nbsp;</span></h3><span style="font-family: inherit;">Are you a manual QA Engineer who is more used to the Windows and Mac environments, but aren't really familiar with the Mac Terminal and it's Unix environment? Here are a few good resources I have used to get a refresher:</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /><b>The Command Line Crash Course:</b></span><br /><a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/"><span style="font-family: inherit;">http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/</span></a><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sf0_pFVkuF4/VUn9zZlYhlI/AAAAAAAAKh0/Fb5J4jrZMXs/s1600/cli.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><img border="0" height="260" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sf0_pFVkuF4/VUn9zZlYhlI/AAAAAAAAKh0/Fb5J4jrZMXs/s1600/cli.jpg" width="320" /></span></a></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /><br />Brought by the people who wrote "Learn Python the Hard Way", this free e-book guides the complete novice through using the command line interface on either a Unix / Linux box, or the Mac Terminal. It gives you basic commands to memorize, and touches upon investigating the file system, moving files around, and learning to find the built in manuals to help you.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /><br /><b>Making Flash Cards with Quizlet:</b></span><br /><a href="https://quizlet.com/"><span style="font-family: inherit;">https://quizlet.com/</span></a><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />How to sort through all the new terms you may be hearing about for the first time?

During my morning commute, I go through the list to see what I remember. You can guess them from the front view or the back view, flipping them around by tapping on the screen.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />My favorite way of using the app is to try to remember what Linux commands to type in.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4qZkqgwsTTQ/VU1ReoV35dI/AAAAAAAAKi4/C333SdGj8gg/s1600/guess.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><img border="0" height="209" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4qZkqgwsTTQ/VU1ReoV35dI/AAAAAAAAKi4/C333SdGj8gg/s320/guess.png" width="320" /></span></a></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /><br />By the way, the answer is:&gt;&nbsp;<i>mv a.txt b.txt</i></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Ryan's Tutorials: Linux Tutorial</b></span><br /><a href="http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/"><span style="font-family: inherit;">http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/</span></a><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kbI6fA9bCxA/VUn9bwOXNNI/AAAAAAAAKhs/Rez1PN0fHn8/s1600/Ryan.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><img border="0" height="260" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kbI6fA9bCxA/VUn9bwOXNNI/AAAAAAAAKhs/Rez1PN0fHn8/s1600/Ryan.jpg" width="320" /></span></a></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Made it through the beginner's lessons? Ryan Chadwick's free site can take you from there. He breaks lessons down into small, easy to manage steps. At the end of each chapter, he gives you questions you can use as a springboard to dive deeper into the Linux command line.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Chapters involve basic navigation, using files, manual pages, permissions, searching in files with grep, and shell scripting.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Ryan even gives a good introduction of the Vi Text Editor.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /><b>The Linux System Administrator's Guide</b>:</span><br /><a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/index.html"><span style="font-family: inherit;">http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/index.html</span></a><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8i6d2r43rE8/VU1O8MgDbwI/AAAAAAAAKik/i0a63pWjo70/s1600/SAG.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><img border="0" height="223" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8i6d2r43rE8/VU1O8MgDbwI/AAAAAAAAKik/i0a63pWjo70/s320/SAG.png" width="320" /></span></a></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Although a bit older, this text-based document written by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tldp.org/" target="_blank">Linux Documentation Project</a>&nbsp;is a good guide that gives the user more detailed information such as the directory tree (/etc, /dev, /usr), init, and system management. The last few chapters, which I am still working through, might not pertain to a Mac Terminal, but would be still good to know.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />After this, I just have to wonder...
