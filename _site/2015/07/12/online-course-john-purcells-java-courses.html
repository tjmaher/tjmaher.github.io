To help me up-to-speed with Java programming after a ten year absence of writing any type of code, I have been working since January through many helpful courses I have found online. A few that I have liked:<br /><br /><ul><li>Alan Richardson's <a href="http://courses.compendiumdev.co.uk/courses/selenium-2-webdriver-with-java" target="_blank">Selenium 2 WebDriver Basics with Java</a>&nbsp;</li><li>MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-0" target="_blank">Programming Using Python</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><br />Another favorite of mine is John Purcell's "<a href="http://www.caveofprogramming.com/" target="_blank">Cave of Programming</a>". John started out on Udemy.com, but has branched out to his own site. Every time he comes up with the next level of a course, he marks the earlier levels down until over time they become free.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />Here is a list of a few of his free courses:<br /><br /><b>Java for the Complete Beginner</b>: <a href="http://courses.caveofprogramming.com/courses/java-for-complete-beginners">http://courses.caveofprogramming.com/courses/java-for-complete-beginners</a><br /><br /><ul><li>Covers: if, for, while loops, switches, arrays, classes, objects, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, interfaces, using generics, handling exceptions, enums types.
