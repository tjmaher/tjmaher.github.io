So, I just added my second small Selenium / Java test to Fitbit - Boston's automated test suite of its eCommerce application. Up until now, my main focus was helping out with manual testing. Doing automation was mainly a side project as I was ramping up since our QA department was short-staffed.<br /><br />...&nbsp;#AmIADeveloperYet?<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />... And when do I become an "official" automated tester?<br /><br />Oh, yeah... probably when I stop counting out how many merges to the codebase I am doing. &nbsp;:)<br /><br />I am so glad that I have this opportunity to learn automation, and a supervisor who has the patience to deal with me getting up to speed!<br /><br /><br />-T.J.
