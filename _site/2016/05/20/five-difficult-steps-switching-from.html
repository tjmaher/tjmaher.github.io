It wasn't too long ago when I was an out-of-work software tester without much experience coding. There are many manual testers -- people who test web and mobile applications the same way customers use them, with a mouse, a keyboard, or a finger on a touch screen -- who are trying to switch to automated testing. I wrote <a href="http://techbeacon.com/switching-careers-qa-manual-testing-automation-development">at length elsewhere</a> about my transition. With this blog post, I wanted to list more of a summary, hoping that other people in the same boat as I was would find it helpful.<br><br><a name="more"></a><br><br><h2>Coding: Getting used to it</h2><br>To get used to coding again, I worked through all of the examples in the free eBook <b>Learning Python the Hard Way</b>: <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/</a> to get used to working with a programming language. I really needed the hand-holding this book offered. Working with Python helped, since it is a language with less ramp up time. <br><br>Then, I purchased <b>Java for Testers</b> at <a href="http://javafortesters.com/">http://javafortesters.com/</a> to ease me into the Java programming language. Anything by <a href="http://eviltester.com/">The Evil Tester</a>, himself, Alan Richardson, is made of awesome. <br><br><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">Java 8</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/">Python 2.7.11</a> seem to be the heavy hitters, when it comes to programming languages. Some companies are still trying to transition from Java 7 to Java 8, but they will do it eventually. Python 3? It came out years ago and hasn't been fully adopted yet. People would rather stick with Python 2 and pull in new features than switch to Python 3.<br><br><h2>Doing the Coursework</h2><br>I purchased Alan Richardson's online course <b>Selenium 2 WebDriver Basics with Java</b>: https://compendiumdev.zenler.com/courses/selenium-2-webdriver-basics-with-java ($299) ... Work through all the Preview material if you can to see if you like his course, his videos, his humor, and his Scottish accent. <br><br>I used Alan Richardson's mildly outdated <b>Selenium Simplified</b> free guide to <b>Get Started</b>: <a href="http://seleniumsimplified.com/get-started/">http://seleniumsimplified.com/get-started/</a> ... I set up <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on my home PC. Either this or <a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a> seems to be the new standard.  <br><br><h2>Doing the Coursework right!</h2><br>When working through an online course, if it is showing in the video someone typing code into IntelliJ, I am typing, too! <br><br>The left half of my screen contains the video playing in a browser. The right half of my screen is filled is my IntelliJ window. <br><br>... The instructor types? I type. The video executes the code? I do too... I accidentally wasted two months simply passively listening to the lectures. I retained completely no information I supposedly learned. <br><br><h2>Create Code of My Own</h2><br>Once I got a hang of things, I started looking around for things to automate, such as Dave Haeffner's test site, "The Internet" on <a href="https://github.com/tourdedave/the-internet">https://github.com/tourdedave/the-internet</a> and <a href="http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/">http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/</a> . <br><br><h2>Share the Code!</h2><br>I signed up for a GitHub account, creating a coding portfolio displaying automation coding examples I came up with: <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/</a>  <br><br>Once I had the GitHub account filled with coding examples, I could prove to employers that I had what it takes to do the job.  <br><br>Hope that helps!  <br><br>Happy Testing! <br><br>-T.J.
