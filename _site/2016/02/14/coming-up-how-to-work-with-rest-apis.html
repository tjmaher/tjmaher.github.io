The next series of blog posts will cover my latest project as an automation developer at Fitbit-Boston: Working with RESTful APIs, such as the one Stripe uses to process credit card transactions. Stripe graciously provides the general public a general use key to access their services. Topics covered:<br /><ul><li>Walking manual QA Engineers -- who may have a bit of Java programming experience -- through setting up their development environment.</li><li>Introduction and a brief history of RESTful APIs.</li><li>Introduction to the Stripe API and walkthrough of their excellent documentation.</li><li>How to interact with Stripe through Apache's HTTP Components such as HTTP Client, HTTP Post, HTTPGet, and URI Builder and Java.</li></ul>I covered in my blog about how at work we were having conversations about&nbsp;<a href="http://0.0.7.224/02/testing-beyond-ui-testing-pyramid.html" target="_blank">Testing Beyond the UI: The Testing Pyramid</a>. The work that I am doing is the next step in that process.<br /><br />Please note: I've only been an automation developer for a bit less than a year, and I have only been working with HTTP Components for a few weeks, which makes me this all brand-new to me, too. That is why I am attempting this project: By forcing myself to explain what I have been doing, it will deepen my knowledge.<br /><br />I was wondering, if you are more experienced that I, if you could do a code review when I am finished? I will be publishing working code on my GitHub account. Feel free to add any comments or constructive criticism in the Comments section at the bottom of the page.<br /><br />These blog posts will be starting this Tuesday, and will be published every Tuesday and Thursday until the project is complete.
