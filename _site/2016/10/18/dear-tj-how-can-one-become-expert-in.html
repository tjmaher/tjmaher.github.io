I may become an expert if I try real hard for the next two or three years, but by then, a brand-new automation toolset will come out, and I will be a newbie, a novice, just like before.<br /><br />I am still not used to programming. I have only been doing it on-the-job for two years. There is so much to learn! I always feel like I am about to drown in all the information that I need to know. Somehow, I have managed to keep my head above water, and I am very thankful for that.<br /><br />The reason why my blog jumps from topic to topic is because my job does, too. A new manager, a new job, a new direction leads to a new automated toolset to learn. Coming up with sample code for my blog is how I scramble to catch up. <br /><br />I have to tell you, I have <b>never had more fun</b> in my twenty year career as I am having right now in my adventure in automation!<br /><br />I hope you are having fun, too! If we all keep at it enough, one day, we all will become experts!<br /><br />As always, Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
