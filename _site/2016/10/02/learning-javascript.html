He borrowed from several programming languages: Java (syntax, primitive values versus objects), Scheme and AWK (first-class functions), Self (prototypal inheritance), and Perl and Python (strings, arrays, and regular expressions).</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>"JavaScript did not have exception handling until ECMAScript 3, which explains why the language so often automatically converts values and so often fails silently: it initially couldn’t throw exceptions. On one hand, JavaScript has quirks and is missing quite a bit of functionality (block-scoped variables, modules, support for subclassing, etc.). On the other hand, it has several powerful features that allow you to work around these problems. In other languages, you learn language features. In JavaScript, you often learn patterns instead". - <a href="http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch01.html" target="_blank"><b>Speaking JavaScript, Chapter 1</b></a>.</i></blockquote><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AvBiGWeBiYc/V_E-lGDsSAI/AAAAAAAALeI/Qlz3tpYuKQMuqX-QAJpPo-IDXKOCQPKIQCLcB/s1600/Brendan_Eich_Mozilla_Foundation_official_photo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AvBiGWeBiYc/V_E-lGDsSAI/AAAAAAAALeI/Qlz3tpYuKQMuqX-QAJpPo-IDXKOCQPKIQCLcB/s200/Brendan_Eich_Mozilla_Foundation_official_photo.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Brendan Eich, Official Mozilla photo</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />You can read a lot more about how and why Netscape and Sun Microsystems back in 1995 created JavaScript in Alex Rauschmayer's&nbsp;<a href="http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch04.html" target="_blank"><b>Speaking JavaScript, Chapter 4</b></a>, and how ECMAScript versions 1 thru 6 came about in <a href="http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch05.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a> of the book.<br /><br /><h2>How Has JavaScript Evolved?</h2><br />I never really knew JavaScript back in the mid 1990s.<br /><br />We were never formally introduced until grad school around 2001 or so.

The popularity of Ajax was ushering in a new age of dynamic web applications, while JavaScript hadn’t changed since the third edition of ECMA-262 was published in 1999. TC-39, the committee responsible for driving the ECMAScript development process, put together a large draft specification for ECMAScript 4. ECMAScript 4 was massive in scope, introducing changes both small and large to the language. Updated features included new syntax, modules, classes, classical inheritance, private object members, optional type annotations, and more.<br /><br />"The scope of the ECMAScript 4 changes caused a rift to form in TC-39, with some members feeling that the fourth edition was trying to accomplish too much. A group of leaders from Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft created an alternate proposal for the next version of ECMAScript that they initially called ECMAScript 3.1. The '3.1' was intended to show that this was an incremental change to the existing standard.<br /><br />"ECMAScript 3.1 introduced very few syntax changes, instead focusing on property attributes, native JSON support, and adding methods to already-existing objects. Although there was an early attempt to reconcile ECMAScript 3.1 and ECMAScript 4, this ultimately failed as the two camps had difficulty with the very different perspectives on how the language should grow.<br /><br />"In 2008, Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, announced that TC-39 would focus its efforts on standardizing ECMAScript 3.1. They would table the major syntax and feature changes of ECMAScript 4 until after the next version of ECMAScript was standardized, and all members of the committee would work to bring the best pieces of ECMAScript 3.1 and 4 together after that point into an effort initially nicknamed ECMAScript Harmony.<br /><br />"ECMAScript 3.1 was eventually standardized as the fifth edition of ECMA-262, also described as ECMAScript 5. The committee never released an ECMAScript 4 standard to avoid confusion with the now-defunct effort of the same name. Work then began on ECMAScript Harmony, with ECMAScript 6 being the first standard released in this new 'harmonious' spirit.<br /><br />"ECMAScript 6 reached feature complete status in 2015 and was formally dubbed “ECMAScript 2015.” (But this text still refers to it as ECMAScript 6, the name most familiar to developers.) The features vary widely from completely new objects and patterns to syntax changes to new methods on existing objects. The exciting thing about ECMAScript 6 is that all of its changes are geared toward solving problems that developers actually face".</blockquote>Can't wait to read the rest of the book!<br /><br /><h2></h2><h2>How Does JavaScript and Selenium WebDriver Intersect?</h2>To talk about how JavaScript and Selenium WebDriver intersect, let's jump to a different source, Dave Haeffner and his <a href="https://seleniumguidebook.com/" target="_blank">Selenium Guidebook</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Md-RRAV3Vzw/V_E8QsNXEcI/AAAAAAAALd4/uzn0Ml05NIgPC08kc5zk293AihCEuWSUACLcB/s1600/bookcover.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Md-RRAV3Vzw/V_E8QsNXEcI/AAAAAAAALd4/uzn0Ml05NIgPC08kc5zk293AihCEuWSUACLcB/s320/bookcover.png" width="246" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Selenium Guidebook</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />I <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/06/spotlight-on-dave-haeffner.html" target="_blank">wrote about Dave last year</a>, covering his free blog <a href="http://elementalselenium.com/tips" target="_blank">Elemental Selenium and its Archive of Tips</a>&nbsp;( see the <a href="https://github.com/tourdedave/elemental-selenium-tips" target="_blank">sourcecode</a>), his countless numbers of free instructional videos on YouTube, his wonderful site, <a href="http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">The-Internet</a>, which I used when I was demoing the first automation test framework in Java <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/06/simple-manipulation-of-login-page.html" target="_blank">that I had encountered</a>, and his guidebook, now written for Java, Ruby, Python, C#, and JavaScript. <br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/tjmaher1">@tjmaher1</a> Thanks!

I've always wondered about&nbsp;<a href="https://seleniumguidebook.com/" target="_blank"><b>The Selenium Guidebook</b></a>:&nbsp;<b>The Complete Package </b>and what it was like...<br /><br />I've only ever looked at just the books, first the Java version last year, and the JavaScript version this year. To get around the fact that I didn't purchase the pre-packaged videos, I subscribe to free&nbsp;<a href="https://saucelabs.com/resources/webinars" target="_blank">Sauce Labs Webinars</a>&nbsp;that feature him, then see if he has anything&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dave+haeffner" target="_blank">new on YouTube</a>.<br /><br />Most of all, I wonder about the&nbsp;<b>Selenium Guidebook: The Complete Package</b>&nbsp;and the 10 seat license, currently $799. ($80 per person for a group, rather than $299 per person)<br /><br />I've run meetings, such as bug tracking triage sessions. I've hosted very informal training sessions. I've given many an end-of-sprint product demo session.<br /><br />What I would really love to do is join a team of software testers -- a good mixture of mostly manual testers, a few automated testers, and maybe a Sr. JavaScript coder since I only know Java -- and see if we can break the material down into separate sessions for self-study, where I can act more as a moderator trying to find the answers out with the team, than a lead with all of the answers. <br /><br />If the group gets stuck on something, we could just email or send a tweet to Dave Haeffner for help.<br /><br />Dave Haeffner also allows people to contact him for help, personally, in 30 minute increments, with his Office Hours at <a href="https://www.sohelpful.me/tourdedave" target="_blank">https://www.sohelpful.me/tourdedave</a>&nbsp;...<br /><br />I had been looking for Lead positions... I need to make sure to pitch this as an idea...<br /><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2>What To Use To Write JavaScript Code?</h2><div>Dave Haeffner writes in his Selenium Guidebook, about what Text Editor to use when coding in JavaScript. &nbsp;</div><blockquote>"In order to write Node.js code, you will need to use a text editor. Some popular ones are <a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a>, and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>.<br /><br />"There's also the option of going for an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" target="_blank">WebStorm</a>.&nbsp;It's not free, but there is a free 30-day trial.<br /><br />"It's important to pick an editor that works for you and makes you productive. So if you're new to&nbsp;programming and text editors then it's probably best to go with something more intuitive like&nbsp;Sublime Text or WebStorm. If you end up using WebStorm be sure to check out the&nbsp;documentation on using it with Mocha (<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/2016.2/running-mocha-unit-tests.html?search=mocha" target="_blank">link</a>)". - <i>Dave Haeffner, <b>Selenium Guidebook</b>, JavaScript Edition</i></blockquote>Personally, I like Sublime Text, which is now up to version 3.<br /><br />Want to build and run your JavaScript programs inside <b>Sublime Text 3</b>? Here is a walkthrough of what I have found:<br /><br /><ul><li>Check to see if you have Node already installed. Open a Command Prompt on a Windows machine or the Terminal on the Mac, and type: <i>node --version</i>. Doesn't work? Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/</a>&nbsp;... current version is 4.6.0. I like installing it globally so I can use node commands from any directory.&nbsp;</li><li>Take a look at Pawel Grzybek's article <a href="https://pawelgrzybek.com/javascript-console-in-sublime-text/" target="_blank">JavaScript console in Sublime Text 3</a>. It shows how to create a new Sublime Text build system you can call "JavaScript". On my Windows 10 system at home I used&nbsp;<i>"cmd" : ["node", "$file"]</i> and <i>"selector": "source.js"</i> to the new file, which I called "JavaScript.sublime-build". &nbsp;</li><li>Need to find exactly where Node has been installed? Try from the command line: <i>which node</i> or <i>where node</i>.&nbsp;</li><li>Not familiar with the Command Line? Need help? See <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/05/learning-command-line-interface.html" target="_blank">my post last year</a>.</li></ul><br /><br /><h2>What Thought Leaders Could We Follow?</h2><div>Read the new TechBeacon article written by Mitchell Long, <a href="http://techbeacon.com/javascript-leaders-you-should-follow-twitter" target="_blank">41 JavaScript Experts to Follow on Twitter</a>&nbsp;published 9/30/2016.<br /><br /><br /></div><h2>What If We Need More Hands-On Instruction on JavaScript?</h2><br />I am still attempting to find good (and free) online starter courses in JavaScript that are not woefully outdated.
