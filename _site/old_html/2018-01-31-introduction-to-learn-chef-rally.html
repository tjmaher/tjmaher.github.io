Need to automate configurations for Amazon Web Services? One way to do it is with <a href="http://chef.io/" target="_blank">Chef.io</a>.<br /><br />Chef does the "cooking" metaphor to the hilt! Configurations are "recipes", written in the Ruby programming language, which are stored in a "cookbook". We covered this in early January with <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2018/01/the-ruby-behind-chef.html" target="_blank">The Ruby Behind Chef</a>.<br /><br />This metaphor continues: To automate all of this, you use the product "Test Kitchen".<br /><br />Seems complicated? To help you out, Chef create the most amazing set of documentation I have ever seen: The <b>Learn Chef Rally</b>.<br /><br />From <a href="https://learn.chef.io/modules/getting-started-with-lcr#/" target="_blank">Getting Started With Chef in Learn.Chef.io</a>:<br /><br />"If you're new to Chef, just know that Chef lets you automate all the thingsâ€”infrastructure, applications, compliance and more. Learn Chef Rally will teach you how. It's the hub for Chef and DevOps related resources that will build your skills.<br /><br />"The Learn Chef Rally curriculum is organized by tracks. A track groups related learning activities.<br /><br />"We call each learning activity a module. Modules include a mix of hands-on labs, articles, and videos. Our hands-on labs help you get started quickly on the platform that you care about most.<br /><br />"When you finish a module, you'll see a few quiz questions at the end. Answering these questions correctly gives you credit for having completed the module. You can track your progress on the home page".<br /><br />Since my job will be automating Amazon Web Service tests, spinning up and tearing down environments, I'm starting the module on <a href="https://kitchen.ci/">Test Kitchen</a>: "Infrastructure Code Deserves Tests Too". <br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><br /><h2>What is Kitchen?</h2>In the last blog entry, "What Is the DevOps toolset "Test Kitchen" and Where Did It Come Come from? Fletcher Nicol at ChefConf 2014" we covered a bit about the DevOps tool Test Kitchen.<br /><br />"Kitchen provides a test harness to execute infrastructure code on one or more platforms in isolation.<br /><br />"A driver plugin architecture is used to run code on various cloud providers and virtualization technologies such as Vagrant, Amazon EC2, and Docker. <a href="https://kitchen.ci/docs/drivers">Read more</a><br /><br />"Many testing frameworks are supported out of the box including <a href="https://www.inspec.io/">InSpec</a>, <a href="https://serverspec.org/">Serverspec</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/bats">Bats</a><br /><br />"For Chef workflows, cookbook dependency resolution via <a href="https://docs.chef.io/berkshelf.html/">Berkshelf</a> or <a href="https://docs.chef.io/config_rb_policyfile.html">Policyfiles</a> is supported or include a cookbooks/ directory and Kitchen will know what to do.<br /><br />"Kitchen is used by all <a href="https://kitchen.ci/github.com/chef-cookbooks/">Chef-managed community cookbooks</a> and is the integration testing tool of choice for cookbooks".<br /><br />All of this is taught in the <b>Learn Chef Rally</b> track, <a href="https://learn.chef.io/tracks/infrastructure-automation#/" target="_blank">Infrastructure Automation</a>, which consists of four modules:<br /><br />1) <b><a href="https://learn.chef.io/modules/learn-the-basics">Learn the Chef Basics</a>:</b>&nbsp;"Get started by using Chef to keep your servers in line with the configuration policies you describe. You'll set up a web server and serve a basic home page on your own virtual machine or one that we provide".<br /><br />2) <b><a href="https://learn.chef.io/modules/manage-a-node-chef-server" target="_blank">Manage a node with Chef server</a></b>: "Learn how the Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks and for information about your servers, or nodes".<br /><div><br />3) <a href="https://learn.chef.io/modules/local-development"><b>Get Started With Test Kitchen</b></a>: Learn how to speed up the development process by using Test Kitchen to apply your infrastructure code from your workstation.<br /><br />4) <a href="https://learn.chef.io/modules/beyond-the-basics"><b>Go Beyond the Basics</b></a>: Learn what happens behind the scenes when chef-client runs.<br /><br />... I cannot believe how well organized this all is!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Other tracks I am also interested in:</div><div><ul><li><a href="https://learn.chef.io/tracks/chef-on-aws#/">Chef on AWS</a>: "Looking for AWS on the menu? Place your order here and you'll get a hang for the Chef basics, manage your first node, test Chef cookbooks on temporary cloud instances, and deploy changes to a production-like environment, all on AWS".</li><li><a href="https://learn.chef.io/tracks/continuous-automation#/" target="_blank">Continuous Automation with Chef Automate</a>: "Hungry for continuous automation? Satisfy your appetite with Chef Automate, the platform for continuous development, and learn how it can provide visibility into your infrastructure. Also discover how to deploy a cookbook using the Chef Automate pipeline".&nbsp;</li></ul><br />This looks quite interesting! I think I have everything I need to keep me busy the next couple of months!<br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
