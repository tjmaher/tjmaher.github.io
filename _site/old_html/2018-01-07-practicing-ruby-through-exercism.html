<div>I think I have covered Ruby fundamentals enough this past week! I covered:<br /><br /><ul><li>Franklin Webber's webinar <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2018/01/the-ruby-behind-chef.html" target="_blank">The Ruby Behind Chef</a>, which&nbsp;started me off</li><li>Zed Shaw's <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/" target="_blank">Learning Ruby the Hard Way</a></li><li>Gone through <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/" target="_blank">Ruby in Twenty Minutes</a> using IRB</li><li>Most of Codecademy's free <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby" target="_blank">Learning Ruby</a> course</li><li>Two-thirds of <a href="http://docs.ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/" target="_blank">Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide</a>&nbsp;to immerse myself in more advanced concepts.</li></ul><div>Now, to put all that knowledge that I think I have to the test! I could start with <a href="http://codewars.org/" target="_blank">CodeWars</a> or <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ruby/ruby-tutorials" target="_blank">HackerRank</a>...</div><div><br /></div><div>Instead, I wanted to check out the site Franklin Webber mentioned in his webinar, <b>Exercism.io</b>, an open-source practice area written by a former <a href="http://javaranch.com/" target="_blank">JavaRanch.com</a> volunteer.&nbsp;</div><div><a name='more'></a><br /></div><h2>What is Exercism?</h2><div><ul><li>Official Site:&nbsp;<a href="http://exercism.io/" target="_blank">http://exercism.io</a></li><li>GitHub site:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/exercism/" target="_blank">https://github.com/exercism/</a></li></ul></div><div><br /></div>"Exercism.io is free and Open Source.

Get one</a>! Not only is it a great way to show code samples to future employers, you can also demo your code to other members of Exercism through GitHub.<br /><br /><h2>How Does It Work?&nbsp;</h2><b>From <a href="http://exercism.io/how-it-works/newbie" target="_blank">Exercism.io / How It Works / Newbie</a>:</b></div><div><br />"Using Exercism requires three tools:<br /><ul><li>"Your text editor: Write a solution to an exercise using your favorite text editor.</li><li>"Your command line interface: Fetch problems and submit solutions via the command line (or terminal).</li><li>"The <a href="http://exercism.io/">exercism.io</a> website: Review feedback on your solution and discuss it with other learners on the website.</li></ul>"For each exercise that you do, you'll go through the same basic steps.<br /><ol><li>"Fetch the exercise using the command line.</li><li>"Write code to solve the exercise on your own computer, satisfying each of the tests.</li><li>"Submit your solution using the command line. If you get stuck, submit what you have and ask for help. You also get to see other people's solutions to the same problem, which could help you figure it out.</li><li>"Review feedback and look at how other people solved the same problem on the website. Ask questions about what seems interesting or confusing!</li><li>"Improve your solution and resubmit as many times as desired".</li></ol><h2>Getting the Command Line Client</h2><br />Since&nbsp;I have a Windows 10 Machine at home, the first thing I did was go to the GitHub site of&nbsp;<b>Exercism / Windows Installer</b>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/exercism/windows-installer/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/exercism/windows-installer/releases</a>&nbsp;and install it.<br /><br />If you are already logged into the site, you can copy and paste the code to configure Exercism with your API Key, from&nbsp;<a href="http://exercism.io/how-it-works/newbie" target="_blank">http://exercism.io/how-it-works/newbie</a></div><br />After installation, you can see if it works by typing in the language you want to practice, such as in <a href="http://exercism.io/languages/ruby/about" target="_blank">http://exercism.io/languages/ruby/about</a>:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">cd C:\Exercism</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">exercism fetch ruby</span><br /><div></div><br /><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-decoration-color: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><div style="margin: 0px;">... And that starts you with the first problem: Hello World.&nbsp;</div></div><br /><h2>Open the Problem in a Text Editor</h2>You can use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">the new Emacs 25.3</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">the new Vim 7</a>, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">the brand new Notepad++ 7.5.4</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text 3</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/" target="_blank">RubyMine 2017.3</a>, or any other way you can to input code.<br /><br />Lately, though, I have been experimenting with <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom.io</a>, a tool I heard about when I was tinkering with JavaScript last year.<br /><br />Going into&nbsp;<b>C:\Exercism\ruby\hello-world </b>I found three files:<br /><br /><ul><li>GETTING_STARTED.md, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown file</a></li><li>hello_world_test.rb, a Ruby file</li><li>README.md</li></ul><br />After opening them all, I found:<br /><br /><ul><li>README tells you how to install a Ruby library (a "Ruby Gem") called "minitest".</li><li>GETTING_STARTED.md talks about how these exercises will touch upon Test-Driven Development (TDD). You can get started with a <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/testing/intro-to-tdd.html" target="_blank">Ruby TDD Tutorial from JumpStart Labs</a>&nbsp;using minitest. It will also walk you through how to create a Hello World ruby file.</li><li>hello_world_test.rb presents a working minitest file.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>After running the test as instructed on my MS-DOS Command Prompt, hello_world_test.rb, it failed, as the instructions told me it would.</div><div><ul><li>C:\Exercism\ruby\hello-world&gt;ruby hello_world_test.rb</li></ul><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hmtH6KWz0TQ/WlEYbm65ylI/AAAAAAAAMNk/1-IjrXhk6R8sSvn2xkads3qzjT_uLTECACLcBGAs/s1600/helloworld.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="59" data-original-width="519" height="72" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hmtH6KWz0TQ/WlEYbm65ylI/AAAAAAAAMNk/1-IjrXhk6R8sSvn2xkads3qzjT_uLTECACLcBGAs/s640/helloworld.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Yes, Ruby will run on a Windows 10 machine.

Because hello_world.rb does not yet exist! I had not created it.&nbsp;</div><br /><br />*****************************************************<br />"You got an error, which is exactly as it should be.<br />"This is the first step in the Test-Driven Development<br />(TDD) process.<br /><br />"The most important part of the error is<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;cannot load such file<br /><br />"It's looking for a file named hello_world.rb that doesn't<br />exist yet.<br /><br />"To fix the error, create an empty file named hello_world.rb<br />in the same directory as the hello_world_test.rb file.<br /><br />"Then run the test again".<br />*****************************************************<br /><br /><h2>Add Content To The File</h2>Run the test again, and it is another new error. Why? The hello_world.rb file is blank.<br /><br />Next, you need to start adding to the blank hello_world file.<br /><br />You will keep on doing this:<br /><br /><ul><li>Working towards a solution to a new exercise.</li><li>Running your program.&nbsp;</li><li>Finding errors.&nbsp;</li><li>Reading the error messages, and figuring out how to interpret them.</li><li>Fixing errors.&nbsp;</li><li>Running your program.</li><li>Success!

The MiniTest HelloWorldTest:<br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">class HelloWorldTest &lt; Minitest::Test</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">&nbsp; def test_say_hi</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; # skip</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; assert_equal "Hello, World!", HelloWorld.hello</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">&nbsp; end</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">end</span><br /><br /><br />This is a pretty wonderful simulation of how programming in the real world really works!<br /><br />My advice? Never cut-and-paste code. Even if you are using someone else's solution, always, always type it out. Run it. See if you can understand it. Compare the keywords used to the official Ruby documentation.<br /><br />You only learn by grappling with a problem and studying a solution. Cutting-and-pasting will never do you any favors in learning how to code.<br /><br />Pssst! They don't want you to do "puts 'Hello, World!'" and print the output to the screen. They want you to:<br /><br /><ul><li>return 'Hello, World!'</li></ul><div>... If you are brand new to Ruby, you just might not understand that is what MiniTest wants.</div><br /><h2><br />Does it Pass? Ship it!&nbsp;</h2>"When everything is passing, you can submit your code with the following<br />command":<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; $ exercism submit hello_world.rb<br /><br />... And there were minor complications:<br /><br /><ul><li>Exercism is on C:\, not C:\Exercism\ruby\hello=world directory. It is not a global command (yet)</li><li>exercism fetch: shows where exactly where hello-world is located, i.e.&nbsp;C:\Exercism\ruby\hello-world, so I had to do the following...</li><li>C:\Exercism&gt;exercism submit C:\Exercism\ruby\hello-world\hello_world.rb&nbsp;</li></ul><br />"Programmers generally spend far more time reading code than writing it.<br /><br />"To benefit the most from this exercise, find 3 or more submissions that you can learn something from, have questions about, or have suggestions for.<br /><br />"Post your thoughts and questions in the comments, and start a discussion.<br />Consider revising your solution to incorporate what you learn.<br /><br />"Yours and others' solutions to this problem: <a href="http://exercism.io/tracks/ruby/exercises/hello-world" target="_blank">http://exercism.io/tracks/ruby/exercises/hello-world</a>"<br /><br />One problem down.
