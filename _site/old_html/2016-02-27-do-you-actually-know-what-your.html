When it comes to automated tests for your software application, what is more important?<br /><br /><ul><li>Knowing that a test passed or failed</li><li>Knowing <i>how</i> a test passed or failed&nbsp;</li></ul><br />Without adequate reporting, you will never be able to tell what is being tested, how it is being tested, and whether the test is being thorough enough.<br /><br />When I was a manual tester, I <i>always</i> made sure to write up a test case.<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Summary Heading</b> : What I am hoping the test is going to accomplish</li><li><b>Steps to Reproduce</b>: A bullet pointed list of the specific parameters I am using to test the application, and where I am entering them.</li><li><b>Results</b>: &nbsp;What did I expect the results to be? What were the actual results? Did it (PASS) or (FAIL)?&nbsp;</li></ul><br />The Steps to Reproduce were quite important. When investigating the possible failure, they might pass with a similar set of parameters, but only fail with the exact parameters you used.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />Or, the problem might be between the keyboard and the chair: The results might be correct, but my assumptions about how the product is supposed to work is not.<br /><br />Or the test might only skim the surface of the application, and it does not go deep enough to reach a trouble spot.<br /><br />Or the test might be mistakenly listing completely invalid data as being perfectly valid.<br /><br />... Without an audit trail, you can never truly be sure.<br /><br />I carried these habits into my new role as an automation developer.<br /><br /><ul><li>When my Selenium WebDriver test opens a web application, logs into the system, selects a link, enters text into a textbox, chooses a radio button or an item from a dropdown listbox, or clicks a button, I keep a record of it.&nbsp;</li><li>When there is a unique ID such as an Order ID or a Confirmation Number, I keep a record of it.&nbsp;</li><li>When my test goes to a unique page like the Order Summary Page for an order, a manual tester can use to go to the exact page than has the error, I keep a record of the url.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>That recording of the results can then can be archived by name and a date/ timestamp, printed out in the Jenkins log files, or into an application such as TestRail, storing what passed, what failed, and how the tests were performed.&nbsp;</div><br /><br />Take a look at the following test. Without knowing anything about the application, you can see exactly how the test was performed.<br /><br /><b>Verify Customer Service can process a Full Refund for ARIA | US-NON-TAX | Free Shipping</b><br /><style type="text/css">pre.CICodeFormatter{  font-family:arial;  font-size:12px;  border:1px dashed #CCCCCC;  width:99%;  height:auto;  overflow:auto;  background:#f0f0f0;  line-height:20px;    padding:0px;  color:#000000;  text-align:left; } pre.CICodeFormatter code{  color:#000000;  word-wrap:normal; } </style> <br /><pre class="CICodeFormatter"><code class="CICodeFormatter"> [ LOGIN: Going to the Commerce Admin Tool (CAT) Login page.  <br />   ,   <br />   , LOGIN: Entering Username.  <br />   , LOGIN: Enter Password.  <br />   , LOGIN: SUCCESS!  <br />   ,   <br />   , Navigating to the Service Home page...  <br />   ,   <br />   , SERVICE_HOME: Creating an Order:  <br />   ,      * Order Type: Standard Order  <br />   ,      * Clicking the 'SELECT_STORE_CONTAINER'.  <br />   ,      * Entering into the textbox: 'United States'  <br />   ,      * Selecting ProductFamily: 'Aria'  <br />   ,      * Selecting SKU Dropdown: 'Aria (White)'  <br />   ,      * Selecting [CREATE ORDER] button.  <br />   , SERVICE_HOME: Checking for errors...  <br />   , SERVICE_HOME: ...
