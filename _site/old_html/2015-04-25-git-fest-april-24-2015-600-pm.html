It was National Sovereignty Day. She talked about Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic. The date was also National Children's Day, since Ataturk dedicated the Turkish Republic to the children. Children's festivals take place all day, and Turkish schoolchildren take seats in Parliment. In honor of the day, they had the event catered from <a href="http://www.bostonkebabhouse.com/" target="_blank">Boston Kebob House</a>.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: inherit;"></span><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The fact that the <a href="https://twitter.com/Meetup">@Meetup</a> event I am attending tonight is called "GitFest" makes me giggle. <a href="http://t.co/otd1wDQ5MC">http://t.co/otd1wDQ5MC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nese?src=hash">#nese</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/git?src=hash">#git</a></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">â€” T.J.

It allows a team of software developers to work together. You can checkout code from a master branch to your local machine, such as the MacBook where you are developing code. You can pull any changes to the master branch down to your development workstation creating a local branch on your machine. You can commit your changes to the master branch, adding comments on what code you changed and what bugs the commit fixes. After the code has been reviewed, you can attempt to push the changes to the master branch, and hopefully there will not be any merge conflicts. When developers do a pull from the master onto their machines, your code changes will be displayed. People can look in the Git history to see what was changed and when, tracking the life of the software project.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />On to the first speaker!&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;">Practicing Git</span></h3><span style="font-family: inherit;">Zach Shaw,</span><br /><i><span style="font-family: inherit;">Organizer, Boston Software Craftmanship</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: inherit;">Principal Software Engineer for Brightcove</span></i><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">[ <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyshaw" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp; | <a href="http://zdsbs.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Blog</a>&nbsp;| Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/zdsbs" target="_blank">@zdsbs </a>&nbsp;]</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />The first speaker was Zach Shaw, from the Meetup.com group, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Software-Craftsmanship/" target="_blank">Boston Software Craftmanship</a>, also known as Boston SC. Boston SC is a monthly group that has been around for the past four years. Its mission is to host sessions so that software engineers can improve software development skills through practice.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />But why practice? And why practice Git?</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Engineers <i>want</i> to practice, but aren't sure what to practice, so these sessions have been set up as a guide. Practice sessions are usually two hours in length. Typical Boston CS sessions run around 10 to 20 attendees at a time and can scale up to 30. And by "practice", Zach told the audience, he meant going through an exercise just for an educational purpose. The problem is that with a job doing software development, you can't really experiment. What they work on during the practice sessions is is something you can delete afterwards. There isn't the pressure programming on the job might bring.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Zach asked a few rhetorical questions to the audience: What is Git? Do you really know what it is and how it works under the covers? Can you get Git to do what you want? Do you know what your SCM (<i>Software Configuration Management</i>) messages should be like? What is your Git philosophy? When do you use Git? When do you merge your code into the master branch? What makes a good branching strategy?</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i><span style="font-family: inherit;">"Git is all about communication. What does your Git commits tell you as a story"?</span></i></blockquote><span style="font-family: inherit;">Zach described a <a href="http://github.com/moss/messaging-exercise" target="_blank">Messaging Exercise in Git</a>&nbsp;he used in a practice session.</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>From the Messaging Exercise site</b>:&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;">"In this coding exercise, you gradually evolve an application for sending two different types of messages, emails and IM chats, through a network connection. The mechanics of input and output are drastically oversimplified (command-line input, and output to one single writer that represents different network connections), but are just realistic to simulate some of the issues that a real app would face. There are a series of end-to-end tests representing eight different user stories. All but the first are annotated with @Ignore. Once the first story is complete, remove the @Ignore from the second and start work on it, and so on".</span></blockquote><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Zach mentioned in this practice session, people worked with this exercise in teams of three, trying to produce what they thought was <b><i>the</i></b> idealized git history. They also tried to figure out what they could do within an hour, then compared notes on how much they got off course. How big the commits should be and how small.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Zach ended that section by asking the audience:</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><i>"The question is... what is your ideal git commit history, and what is your git philosophy"?</i></span></blockquote><span style="font-family: inherit;">With the next section of his talk, Zach talked to the audience about how they could map out the Git process and history using a <b>Directed Acyclic Graph</b>, a way to model information.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />... I found a chapter the next day describing <a href="http://ericsink.com/vcbe/html/directed_acyclic_graphs.html" target="_blank">Directed Acyclic Graphs</a>&nbsp;in the online text <a href="http://ericsink.com/vcbe/html/" target="_blank"><b>Version Control By Example</b></a>&nbsp;(2011) by Eric Sink.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Zach gave a new challenge to the audience: How fast can you be just manipulating the DAG? He introduced a multimedia course called "Learn Git Branching" at <a href="http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/">http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/</a> by <a href="http://petermcottle.com/" target="_blank">Peter Cottle</a>.&nbsp;</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i><span style="font-family: inherit;">"LearnGitBranching is a git repository visualizer, sandbox, and series of educational tutorials and challenges. Its primary purpose is to help developers understand git through the power of visualization (something that's absent when working on the command line).&nbsp;</span></i></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i><span style="font-family: inherit;">"You can input a variety of commands into LearnGitBranching (LGB) -- as commands are processed, the nearby commit tree will dynamically update to reflect the effects of each command." ( README, <a href="https://github.com/pcottle/learnGitBranching" target="_blank">LearnGitBranching</a>)</span></i></blockquote><span style="font-family: inherit;">Zach said these were exercise to run with a group. Group coding exercises are fun to do, he said. &nbsp;And after the exercises, he would ask participants: Did you get more facile with the DAG? Did you learn more Git commands? People enjoyed improving areas of software engineering.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Zach invited everyone to check out Boston Software Craftmanship. They are on Meetup.com: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Software-Craftsmanship/">http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Software-Craftsmanship/</a></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Their next Meetup, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Software-Craftsmanship/events/221778761/" target="_blank">April's Boston Code and Cocktails</a> ion Tuesday, April 28th in Central Square, Cambridge. I need to check them out! I wonder if some fellow Fitbit developers might want to walk over to check it out with me? I need to to remember to ask around the Boston office... I earned my degrees a bit under ten years ago but haven't really coded on the job until now. I have a lot of catch up to do!&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Pardon me as I run around like a cat whose tail is on fire. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Oh! The next lecturer is coming up...</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;">Three ways are better when merging</span></h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Stephen Vance</span><br /><i><span style="font-family: inherit;">Director of Agile at Zipcar</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: inherit;">Co-organizer, Boston Software Craftmanship</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: inherit;">Co-organizer of NESE</span></i><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[</span> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srvance" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;| Site: <a href="http://vance.com/">Vance.com</a>&nbsp;| Twitter: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/stephenrvance" target="_blank">@StephenRVance</a>&nbsp; | <a href="https://github.com/srvance" target="_blank">GitHub</a>&nbsp;]</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />...

There is a GUI you can use, though, by Perforce called P4Merge that you can <a href="http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools" target="_blank">download</a>. It is a better three way merge tool.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />1. Download and install P4Merge</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">2. &nbsp;Add it to your path, such as with a Mac:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">export PATH=${PATH} :/Applications/p4merge.app/Contents/MacOS</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />3. Configure git to know about it.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">git config -- global merge.tool p4merge</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">git difftool --tool-help</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />4. Use it</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">git difftool some.txt</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Back in the console, you might see messages mimicking what you are doing in the GUI. You can turn that off:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">git difftool --no-prompt some.txt</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">git config mergetool.prompt off</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />You need to remember to set up the mergetool, not just the diff tool:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">git checkout master</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">git merge other // where "other" is the name of a branch in this example.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">git mergetool</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Steve mentioned that he has seen online how people are setting up shell scripts to tell the tool where the tool is located. You don't need a shell script, just set up the path.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Once that is done, you can see three way merges, three panels.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Let's say you do in the Terminal window of your MacBook: git status and get back that there is a merge conflict. You can start the merge tool by </span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">git mergetool</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Let's say you have "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" and you are missing an s at the end. You can compare the three panes. You can pick the original in the first pane, or the edit in the middle, or both in the third pane. Now run:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">git status</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Merge conflict is resolved. You can do your commit and your merge is done. Much better insight to your merges.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />In the Q&amp;A session, some people asked about using IntelliJ. Steve mentioned IntelliJ is still a 2-way tool even though it is better than other 2 way merge tools. Steve mentions if he is already developing with it, he uses their built-in feature for simple merges. Complex merges, Steve drops out and uses PForce. The basic commit / add / edit workflow, it contained in IntelliJ. When he is using the Sublime text editor, he usually doesn't do commits with Sublime's built-in features, and he just drops down to the tool. Simple merges he also does with the command line.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;">Git is History:&nbsp;Using the history for fun and profit</span></h3><span style="font-family: inherit;">Kenneth Sebesta</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px;"><i>Senior Controls Engineer at CyPhy Works Inc</i></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: x-small;">[ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennsebesta" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> ]&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Ken started off his talk on Git mentioning how he uses Git... It isn't the best way, but it is his way.&nbsp;There is a lot of ways to use Git. Some of his stuff works for him, on his own. His way though is brittle. He is continously doing ten merges in a row and having it break. "Weird integration issues. Not very fun".</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;">"SCM (Software Control Management) is all about history. Why don't we use it all the way? Atomic commit. Thinking about the future, picture yourself looking at the code five years form now".</span></blockquote><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ken presented a quote from Peter Hutterer, a software engineer at Redhat, taken from Peter's essay, "<a href="http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html" target="_blank">On Commit Messages</a>" &nbsp;<i>12/28/2009</i></span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><i>"Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful".</i></span></blockquote><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Ken metioned that Git commits should be atomic. If you have two features, split them in two separate commits. The most atomic commits possible.It is challenging, to make atomic commits while code is being modified. The problem is that the whitespace fixes, the style fixes, they all get jumbled up, and it is difficult to track later what happened with the code change.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Ken told the audience: Use a GUI. Don't be stubborn. Git comes built-in with a tool, Git-Gui <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui">http://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui</a>. It is the same across platforms, whether they are Mac, Windows or Linux.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">If there is difficulty in separating things out because it is two different ideas, use two commits.</span></li></ul><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">The two minutes you spend now will save you thirty minute in the future trying to figure out what the commit did in the first place. When you are hunting a weird interaction bugs interoduced in a merge, you wil thank yourself.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Label broken code as </span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">***broken***</span><span style="font-family: inherit;"> or </span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">***untested***</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Be verbose. You are writing history.</span></li></ul><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you think about it, the <i>Who</i>, <i>Where</i> and <i>When</i> of a change in the code is taken care of when you use Git. You just need to take care of the <i>Why.</i></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />Why did you make your change? Was something broken? Describe the broken functionality. It is educational for the people who follow you on GitHub. Describe the fix.</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;">"Describe the <i>What</i>: Explain the change. Not everyone is familiar as you are. Provide as many links to the subject as you can. Provide deep link when possible so that people don't have to guess why it is being used.&nbsp;Don't use shallow links".</span></blockquote><h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">What does a good commit message line look like?</span></h4><ul><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">The first line should be short: 50 characters or less, almost like a Book Title and a subtitle, such as:&nbsp;<i>Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</i></span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Leave a space</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the body use a newline after approximately 72 characters wide.

If it doesn't have a good commit message, you should fail the code review.</span><br /><h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">An example of a good commit message:</span></h4><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ken went to <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js" target="_blank">angular / angular.js</a> on GitHub. he observed that there were over 6,000 commits to the codebase.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />An excellent version of a commit statement would be:</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-18ut1Aa6jXo/VTvidH8ohgI/AAAAAAAAKhE/3OVTCN6HY08/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-25%2Bat%2B2.50.50%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><img border="0" height="227" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-18ut1Aa6jXo/VTvidH8ohgI/AAAAAAAAKhE/3OVTCN6HY08/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-25%2Bat%2B2.50.50%2BPM.png" width="400" /></span></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">With this commit message, you can tell by the commit header, the commit description, you know exactly what code was changed.

It shows a carefully cultivated history. If you are doing nothing more than fixing whitespace, he&nbsp;recommends&nbsp;adding a message such as "fixed style changes". &nbsp;Do one commit for tidying up the whitespace, then another commit for the actual code change. But if you goofed up, forgot an #include statement, just rebase.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ken mentioned that that his company <a href="http://cyphyworks.com/" target="_blank">CyPhy works</a> is hiring.
