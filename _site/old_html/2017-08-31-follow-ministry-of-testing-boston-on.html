I am happy to announce that I am the new Organizer of the Ministry of Testing, Boston chapter! ... or, at least that is what I have dubbed myself.<br /><br />Back in January 2017, when the Greater Boston QA and Testing Meetup moved under the <a href="http://www.ministryoftesting.com/" target="_blank">Ministry of Testing</a>'s umbrella, a community of software testers in the UK that was expanding into the United States, three things happened:<br /><br /><ul><li>The Meetup group was rebranded the "<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston" target="_blank">Ministry of Testing - Boston</a>".</li><li>I was invited by the founder of the group, Conrad Holloman, to be co-organizer, helping to plan meetups. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>After month or so, I was asked if I could mind the store for the Spring. Between Conrad going back on duty and needing to put more effort in running a group he co-founded, <a href="https://medium.com/operation-code" target="_blank">Operation Code</a> -- training veterans in a new software development career -- he wouldn't be available.&nbsp;</li></ul>After six months of me going all gung-ho, running targeted Facebook and Twitter ads for the group, running two or more events a month, cold-calling and cold-emailing to see if they could host a Meetup event and possibly speak to our group... Conrad mentioned that he was stepping down. Could I possibly fill the Organizer role?<br /><br />I have to say, I am having the most fun with the group! I have been recruiting friends of mine to speak to the group. I somehow managed to get <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/06/notes-on-moshe-milmans-talk-advanced.html" target="_blank">Moshe Milman</a>, the CEO of Applitools to the group. <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/07/q-with-angie-jones-ministry-of-testing.html" target="_blank">Angie Jones</a>, via web conference spoke live from Twitter's San Francisco office.
