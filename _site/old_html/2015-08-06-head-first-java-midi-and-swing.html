Now that I found a job where I get paid to write code, I might as well try to practice the language, eh?<br /><br />Over the past few months, in my quest to practice being a developer, I have been trying to come up with cute little side-projects in Java that I could do in my free time, and I have been reading more than a few textbooks to come up with ideas. <br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />I first heard of "Head First Java <i>(2nd Edition, 2005)</i>" back in February when I was interviewing   for automated testing positions over at Harvard University. Although I   didn't get the position, when the hiring manager and I exchanged emails   afterwards he referred me to two books to help me brush up on my Java   skills, long unused as a manual software tester. I was referred to: Murach's Java Programming ( <a href="https://www.murach.com/shop/murach-s-java-programming-detail" target="_blank">Official Site</a>) &nbsp;and Head First   Java ( <a href="http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjava/" target="_blank">Official Site</a> ). After   reading a few sample chapters of each book, I went with "Head First Java".<br /><br /><h3>Head First Java</h3><br />&nbsp;I have to say, I have never been so amused by a computer programming   textbook! Thank you, Gray, for referring me to it! It talks about how Java   manages memory, about creating multi-threading apps, sockets, user   interfaces with Java's Swing library, and making music through Java's MIDI   library but it does it in such a hilarious way that it cracks you up, with   stock images from the 1950s, jokes, bad puns, and mock interviews with the   concepts they are talking about.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--tjiBvQJpSE/VcBCVxjyHFI/AAAAAAAAKwc/oBdARMpOhJg/s1600/head_first_java.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--tjiBvQJpSE/VcBCVxjyHFI/AAAAAAAAKwc/oBdARMpOhJg/s1600/head_first_java.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">As found on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208/" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">What caught my eye were the following blurbs in the introduction:</span></h4><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i><b>"Who the book is for:&nbsp;</b></i></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"Do you prefer stimulating dinner party conversation to dry, dull, academic   lectures?"

After spending so much time with very dry texts studying, I found it to be a refreshing change of pace to get me back in the swing of things re-learning Java.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BQzq6WvQN-Y/VcNx5bAHgaI/AAAAAAAAKw4/_D64CJQRfYY/s1600/swimmer.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="244" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BQzq6WvQN-Y/VcNx5bAHgaI/AAAAAAAAKw4/_D64CJQRfYY/s320/swimmer.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Warning: They have a lot of cute graphics, like the ones above.<br /><br /><h3>My Favorite Project: The BeatBox app</h3>My favorite code example of theirs was the <b><i>BeatBox</i></b> application found in their   chapter on <i>Using Swing</i>, Java's built-in graphical user interface toolset. I remember getting into developing user interfaces as a Computer Science major, using Charles Petzold's textbook&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Windows%C2%AE-Edition-Developer-%20Reference/dp/157231995X" target="_blank">Programming Windows</a>&nbsp;using C and Windows 95. When I encountered the Java's Swing library in my Advanced Programming in Java class in grad school, I found it a lot easier to work with.<br /><br />With the BeatBox app, they combine the Swing Library with Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) library as part of Java's Sound API.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-709KOt4Mdn0/VcP-SGmw6uI/AAAAAAAAKxQ/pl3sXTQ7Kv0/s1600/beatbox.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-709KOt4Mdn0/VcP-SGmw6uI/AAAAAAAAKxQ/pl3sXTQ7Kv0/s320/beatbox.png" width="270" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">My version of the BeatBox app</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h4>Sidenote: The Java Sound API:</h4><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"The Java Sound API is a low-level API for effecting and controlling the input and output of sound media, including both audio and Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) data. The Java Sound API provides explicit control over the capabilities normally required for sound input and output, in a framework that promotes extensibility and flexibility.</i>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"The Java Sound API fulfills the needs of a wide range of application developers. Potential application areas include:</i><br /><ul><li><i>"Communication frameworks, such as conferencing and telephony</i></li></ul><ul><li><i>"End-user content delivery systems, such as media players and music using streamed content</i></li></ul><ul><li><i>"Interactive application programs, such as games and Web sites that use dynamic content</i></li></ul><ul><li><i>"Content creation and editing</i></li></ul><ul><li><i>"Tools, toolkits, and utilities</i></li></ul><i>"The Java Sound API provides the lowest level of sound support on the Java platform. It provides application programs with a great amount of control over sound operations, and it is extensible. For example, the Java Sound API supplies mechanisms for installing, accessing, and manipulating system resources such as audio mixers, MIDI synthesizers, other audio or MIDI devices, file readers and writers, and sound format converters. The Java Sound API does not include sophisticated sound editors or graphical tools, but it provides capabilities upon which such programs can be built. It emphasizes low-level control beyond that commonly expected by the end user. - <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/index.html" target="_blank">The Java Tutorials: Sound</a></i></blockquote><br /><h4>Sidenote: About MIDI:</h4><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><i>"MIDI was originally designed for passing musical events, such as key depressions, between electronic keyboard instruments such as synthesizers. Hardware devices known as sequencers stored sequences of notes that could control a synthesizer, allowing musical performances to be recorded and subsequently played back. Later, hardware interfaces were developed that connected MIDI instruments to a computer's serial port, allowing sequencers to be implemented in software. More recently, computer sound cards have incorporated hardware for MIDI I/O and for synthesizing musical sound. Today, many users of MIDI deal only with sound cards, never connecting to external MIDI devices. CPUs have become fast enough that synthesizers, too, can be implemented in software. A sound card is needed only for audio I/O and, in some applications, for communicating with external MIDI devices. - <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/overview-MIDI.html" target="_blank">The Java Tutorials: The MIDI Package</a></i></span></span></blockquote>With the chapter in Head First Java: Using Swing, they walk you through:<br /><br /><ul><li>Setting up a list of sixteen percussion instruments, taken from the MIDI Percussion Key Map.&nbsp;</li><li>Set up a Sequencer to play the music, playing the sequence chosen by the user. It's a fast tempo, 120 beats per minute. The tempo can raised or lowered by the user.&nbsp;</li><li>Set up a GUI with a list of the 16 percussion instruments the user can choose from in the far right column. By checking one of sixteen checkboxes for that instrument, the user crafts the sequence that will be played in a continuous loop.&nbsp;</li><li>Listeners are placed on a Start and a Stop button to play and pause the beatbox.&nbsp;</li></ul><br /><div><div>Even though you can <a href="http://wickedlysmart.com/get-code/" target="_blank">download the sourcecode from the book</a>, cutting and pasting what you need, I find it is easier for me to understand the code by manually typing the code out and experimenting with it.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><h3>A Few Modifications:</h3><div>I made a few changes with the program:<br /><br /><b>Adding New Instrument:</b><br /><br />There are a lot more percussion instruments than the sixteen shown in the example.<br /><br /><table align="center" border="1" class="maintext" style="background-color: white; color: black; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; width: 665px;"><tbody><tr><td colspan="4" width="655"><div align="center" class="mainbold" style="color: #666666; font-weight: bold;">General MIDI Level 1 Percussion Key Map</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" width="655">On MIDI Channel 10, each MIDI Note number ("Key#") corresponds to a different drum sound, as shown below.
