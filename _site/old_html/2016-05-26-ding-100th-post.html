Wow. I can't believe that yesterday's post on <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/05/notes-selenium-3-spec-and-onwards-by.html" target="_blank">Simon Stewart talking about Selenium WebDriver</a> was the 100th post I have created here at <b>Adventures in Automation</b>.<br /><br />This blog was started back on January 24, 2015 as a place to organize my research notes I collected as I was trying to break into the world of automated test development. Now that I am a full-fledged automated test developer, I continue to blog about whatever I am learning at work to help make the new concept stick, inventing new little side-projects to reinforce what I am learning. Hopefully these articles and <a href="https://github.com/tjmaher?tab=repositories" target="_blank">code samples</a> have helped you, too!<br /><br />The act of putting together this blog has made me a better software developer.<br /><br />Thank you, dear reader, for being a part of it.<br /><br />Thank you most of all to:<br /><ul><li>Alan Richardson, <a href="http://www.eviltester.com/" target="_blank">the Evil Tester</a></li><li>Joe Colantonio, from <a href="http://www.testtalks.com/" target="_blank">Test Talks</a></li><li>Matt Hutchinson, the <a href="http://www.testingcurator.com/" target="_blank">Testing Curator</a></li><li><a href="http://www.mrslavcheck.com/" target="_blank">Mr. Slavcheck</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://www.petrikainulainen.net/" target="_blank">Petri Kainulainen&nbsp;</a></li></ul>... and anyone who has given me such excellent <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/p/reviews-of-this-blog.html" target="_blank">Feedback</a> about this blog.<br /><br /><br />-T.J.
