What year is it?<br /><br />The last think I remember, I came home from work early, and sat down in front of my computer. I decided on browsing <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham" target="_blank">Ward Cunningham</a>'s <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiWeb" target="_blank">Wiki Wiki Web</a> &nbsp;-- now over <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardsWikiTenthAnniversary" target="_blank">twenty years</a> old! &nbsp;-- as I have been doing lately, trying to get a feel what it was like in the early days of the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming" target="_blank">Extreme Programming</a> movement which became the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AgileAlliance" target="_blank">Agile Alliance</a>.

It was launched on 25 March 1995 by its inventor, programmer Ward Cunningham, to accompany the Portland Pattern Repository website discussing software design patterns. The name WikiWikiWeb originally also applied to the wiki software that operated the website, written in the Perl programming language and later renamed to 'WikiBase'. The site is frequently referred to by its users as simply 'Wiki', and a convention established among users of the early network of wiki sites that followed was that using the word with a capitalized W referred exclusively to the original site".<br /><br />"[...] The software and website were developed in 1994 by Cunningham in order to make the exchange of ideas between programmers easier. The concept was based on the ideas developed in HyperCard stacks that Cunningham built in the late 1980s. On March 25, 1995, he installed the software on his company's (Cunningham &amp; Cunningham) website, c2.com. Cunningham came up with the name WikiWikiWeb because he remembered a Honolulu International Airport counter employee who told him to take the Wiki Wiki Shuttle, a shuttle bus line that runs between the airport's terminals. 'Wiki Wiki' is a reduplication of 'wiki', a Hawaiian language word for Quick. Cunningham's idea was to make WikiWikiWeb's pages quickly editable by its users, so he initially thought about calling it "QuickWeb", but later changed his mind and dubbed it 'WikiWikiWeb'.</i></blockquote><br />Since I have been trying to somehow turn into a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RealProgrammer" target="_blank">Real Programmer</a>, I have spent a lot of time trying to learn how to incorporate <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnitTest" target="_blank">Unit tests</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatterns" target="_blank">Software Design Patterns</a>&nbsp;into my automation development.<br /><br />I stumbled on this site last year when I was trying to search for tips on <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ObjectOriented" target="_blank">Object Oriented</a> programming. &nbsp;and found out there were <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DefinitionsForOo" target="_blank">many definitions</a> for what that means.<br /><br />Watch out! You can spend hours trying to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage" target="_blank">Find a Page</a>&nbsp;and end up sucked in just like me.<br /><br />Here are a few fun entries I found:<br /><br /><h2>Writing Code</h2><br />There is a huge section on&nbsp;<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming" target="_blank">Extreme Programming</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment" target="_blank">Test Driven Development</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?KentBeck" target="_blank">Kent Beck</a>&nbsp;that I would list as required reading for any manual QA person attempting to get into software development.<br /><br />Make sure to read all about the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AgileManifesto" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a>.<br /><br />After that is done, you can read about <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatterns" target="_blank">Software Design Patterns</a>&nbsp;( and the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GangOfFour" target="_blank">Gang of Four</a> ) which help&nbsp;and <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AntiPattern" target="_blank">AntiPatterns</a> which hinder.<br /><br />Around my workplace, the developers still talk about <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignByContract" target="_blank">Design By Contract</a>.<br /><br />It also has entries on the two text editors still favored: <br /><ul><li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EmacsEditor" target="_blank">Emacs</a></li><li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ViEditor" target="_blank">Vi</a></li><li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EmacsVsVi" target="_blank">Emacs vs Vi</a>: And old time funny flame war!</li></ul><br />It has pages on the two main Integrated Development Environments (IDE) used now: <br /><ul><li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EclipseIde" target="_blank">Eclipse IDE</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?IntellijIdea" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA 2.0</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><br /><h2>Writing Tests&nbsp;</h2><br />When it talked about <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestingFramework" target="_blank">Testing Frameworks</a>&nbsp;I expected the section for <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnit" target="_blank">JUnit</a>&nbsp;written by <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?KentBeck" target="_blank">Kent Beck</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ErichGamma" target="_blank">Erich Gamma</a>. It also has a section on <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestEnGee" target="_blank">TestNG</a>, added six years ago, probably by it's creator <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CedricBeust" target="_blank">Cedric Beust</a>. <br /><br />They also cover various typed of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AutomatedTest" target="_blank">Automated tests</a> such as: <br /><ul><li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnitTest" target="_blank">Unit tests</a></li><li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AcceptanceTest" target="_blank">Acceptance Tests</a></li><li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RegressionTesting" target="_blank">Regression Tests</a></li></ul><br /><h2></h2><h2>Building Software</h2><br />What intrigued me is showcased <b>build tools</b> such as: <br /><ul><li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ApacheAnt" target="_blank">Apache Ant</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AntVsMake" target="_blank">Ant vs Make</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ApacheMaven" target="_blank">Apache Maven</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><br />... Nothing yet on Gradle, though, a build tool we are starting to use more extensively at work. <br /><br />Wiki Wiki Web. It's a nice little time capsule. <br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
