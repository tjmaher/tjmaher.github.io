Adventures in Automation is now two years old! It's messy. It's busy, with text scribbled in every margin. And it's my online home.<br /><br />It also can be difficult to read, with a layout not as clean as today's modern WordPress formats. I do like the cute little Matrix-In-Blue theme, but it can be kinda distracting.<br /><br />Because it would take a lot of work for me to port all of the almost 190 posts I have written to somewhere else, this weekend I reviewed all posts of mine and am in the process of moving the better posts to <b>Medium.com</b> at&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@tjmaher1" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@tjmaher1</a>... one at a time!<br /><br />I've scheduled one revamped entry to be posted per day over the next two weeks. Feel free to follow and favorite what you like!<br /><br /><br />Happy Reading! <br /><br />-T.J.
