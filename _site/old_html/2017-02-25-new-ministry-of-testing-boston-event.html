Automated User Interface (UI) testing continues to grow in popularity and can help save time, money, and eliminate human error in the testing process.<br /><div><br /></div><div>"Appleâ€™s XCTest provides a robust UI testing framework that allows a QA professional to automate most actions a user would perform on a mobile device. With convenient features such as UI recording and the option to write tests in the feature-rich Swift programming language, this framework is a popular and solid choice. Using the case example of an ongoing iPad app build, we will explore how QA professionals can use this framework to build a comprehensive testing suite and touch upon some of the plumbing/DevOps associated with getting up and running and automating aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)". <br /><br />Sign up <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/237975761/" target="_blank">here</a>!<br /><br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
