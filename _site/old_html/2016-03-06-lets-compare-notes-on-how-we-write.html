Good day! I was wondering if I could bother you for a bit. I was working on two projects, one for creating an automated testing framework for an eCommerce site, and one for testing a REST API endpoint:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/tjmaher/RESTful_Testing_Using_Stripe">https://github.com/tjmaher/RESTful_Testing_Using_Stripe</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/tjmaher/automate-amazon">https://github.com/tjmaher/automate-amazon</a></li></ul><br /><br />... I coded them as I would at my workplace.<br /><br />I'd like to recruit other automated developers in the software industry to possibly take a look at it and give me their feedback.<br /><br />Let's compare and contrast what we do in their own workplace.<br /><br />Maybe we could compare notes?<br /><br />Thank you very much for your time!<br /><br />-T.J.
