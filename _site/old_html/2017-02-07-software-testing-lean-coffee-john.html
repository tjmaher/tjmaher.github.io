Tonight, I organized my very first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/" target="_blank">Ministry of Testing - Boston</a> event, a "Lean Coffee".<br /><br />Picture a dinner-and-discussion event run like an Agile end-of-sprint retrospective, where members write down on Post-It Notes things they want to discuss, and people vote on the topics.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LQRl5VKNEUo/WJqPQyGln6I/AAAAAAAALmw/XfD6GCnPOJoFflUeI_HUXONY8mfBq_mIACLcB/s1600/Screenshot%2B2017-02-07%2Bat%2B10.18.00%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="235" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LQRl5VKNEUo/WJqPQyGln6I/AAAAAAAALmw/XfD6GCnPOJoFflUeI_HUXONY8mfBq_mIACLcB/s400/Screenshot%2B2017-02-07%2Bat%2B10.18.00%2BPM.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/236646569/" target="_blank"><i>https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/236646569/</i></a></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />I haven't run an event in at least five years, since I was part of the Nerd Fun - Boston Meetup running five events a week, back in 2008 - 2011. Back then, my favorite place to meet was at John Harvard's Brew House, holding discussions at a large round table that seats fifteen. It is situated under a stairwell, and with the lower ceiling, the acoustics are much better than you would think in the crowded pub atmosphere.<br /><br />I met up people before the event around the corner in the food court of the Harvard Square Garage mall, with my "Hello My Name is T.J." nametag, and a big red MEETUP sign attached to my black messenger bag, just like the old days.<br /><br /><br /><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7RJJpvjgLfQ/WJqftfS_DcI/AAAAAAAALnE/WbNCjFNoQ4s/s400/blogger-image--123265991.jpg" /><br /><br /><br />We filed in at 6:30 pm, and had a lively discussion! Some of the discussion topics:<br /><ul><li>Scrum as a QA Process</li><li>How Can We Tell If Automation is Improving Quality</li><li>Favorite Automation Tool for Agile</li><li>Cucumber vs TestNG vs JUnit</li><li>Should QA be in DEV teams?</li><li>Picking Stable Jobs/ Compaines</li><li>Suggestions for Agile Training</li><li>"Testing" or "QA"</li><li>Lean Coffee at Work</li></ul>It was a good break for me. I have been doing nothing but try to set up interviews for the past few days, trying to find my next automation development gig.<br /><br />If you want to keep track of the discussion, I have posted a conversation thread on the Ministry of Testing - Boston Message Board at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/messages/boards/thread/50584497/" target="_blank">https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/messages/boards/thread/50584497/</a><br /><br />Happy Testing!<br /><br />-T.J.
