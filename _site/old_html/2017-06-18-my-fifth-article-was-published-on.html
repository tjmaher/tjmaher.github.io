I forgot to mention... Back on May 30th, my fifth article from TechBeacon was published: "<a href="https://techbeacon.com/how-qa-can-build-quality-software-development-process" target="_blank">How QA can build quality into the software pipeline</a>"!<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-78Y1VkwHKs0/WUZx4Ur7xAI/AAAAAAAAL2Y/ck5oMszHAGsaE1dN1gVHul_Xj7_fZ-DGwCLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2B2017-06-18%2Bat%2B8.27.23%2BAM.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="752" data-original-width="1280" height="376" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-78Y1VkwHKs0/WUZx4Ur7xAI/AAAAAAAAL2Y/ck5oMszHAGsaE1dN1gVHul_Xj7_fZ-DGwCLcBGAs/s640/Screenshot%2B2017-06-18%2Bat%2B8.27.23%2BAM.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>TechBeacon always finds the cutest opening graphics for my articles!</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />... I do prefer my original title, which referred to the changing definition of quality as you moved from being a manual tester to an automation developer.<br /><br />I can't believe it was a year ago that <a href="https://techbeacon.com/contributors/robert-mitchell" target="_blank">Rob Mitchell</a>, Managing Editor of TechBeacon gave me a call February of 2016 after I inquired about writing for HPE's online magazine... but I had never written professionally before. What the heck do I write about?<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">On Thu, Mar 3, 2016 at 4:45 PM, Robert Mitchell&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">wrote:</span><br /><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="background-color: white; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;"><div>Hi Thomas,</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div style="font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;">I forgot to mention yesterday that our pitch review meeting occurs once a week, so if you put a little flesh on the bones of an idea&nbsp;and get it to me by Monday I can get it reviewed and possibly approved next week.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</div><div style="font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;">If you want to send something along I'll help you shape it.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</div><div style="font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;">I wonder if we could write about your travails and triumphs as you climb the learning curve? It could involve discussing a particular challenge, how you attempted to resolve it, the outcome and ending with asking others what they would do? Just an idea.</div></div></blockquote><br />Instead of an outline, I submitted something written for this blog back in April 2015,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/04/how-to-switch-careers-in-software.html" target="_blank">How to Switch Careers in the Software Industry</a>.<br /><br />Rob broke down what I had submitted into an outline showing the essential elements, and after working on what we had come up with, he submitted the outline as a proposal to the review board. After being accepted, Rob assigned me to&nbsp;<a href="https://techbeacon.com/contributors/mitch-pronschinske" target="_blank">Mitch Pronschinske</a> as my editor. Mitch is amazing! He really helped me through all my insecurities about being a new writer. He always took the time to answer all my many questions, no matter how silly.<br /><br />After a couple of weeks, I came up with "<a href="https://techbeacon.com/switching-careers-qa-manual-testing-automation-development" target="_blank">Switching careers in QA: From manual testing to automation development</a>". Since it was published April 7, 2016, it has had 9,036 pageviews, and has been shared through the sharing sidebar 294 times.<br /><br />Thank you very much, Rob and Mitch for having the all the patience in the world with me as a new writer!<br /><br />Want to see what writing I am working on now?
