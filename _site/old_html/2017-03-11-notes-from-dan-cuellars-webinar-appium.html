Let's see if there are 400 at the end of it. I will try my best!"<br /><br /><b><u>Webinar Agenda</u></b><br /><br /><ul><li>Desktop Apps</li><li>New Appium GUI: Works for Windows, Mac and Linux</li><li>Advanced Appium</li></ul><br /><h3>New: Appium Automates: Desktop Apps for the PC! &nbsp;</h3><br />Selenium is automation for websites. Appium is automation for apps. At first? "App" only meant automation for mobile apps, but now it means any type of app... now including Desktop apps!<br /><br />Dan made one big announcement after another. First it was the WinAppDriver project, found in <a href="http://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver" target="_blank">http://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver</a>, a project from Microsoft.<br /><br />Imagine that: Microsoft themselves are supporting an open-source movement! It would have been unheard of a few years ago. Now, they have come up with Selenium WebDriver support and now Appium support!<br /><br /><b>Microsoft support includes:</b><br /><ul><li>Modern Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps</li><li>Win 32 applications (including pre 2000)</li><li>Windows Presentation Format (WPF) apps</li><li>Windows Forms apps</li><li>Webviews (sometimes)</li><li>Office and Outlook Plugins</li></ul><div>Coming soon from Microsoft:</div><ul><li>Pen &amp; Touch support&nbsp;</li><li>Windows Mobile Phone support</li></ul><b></b><br /><div><b><span style="font-weight: normal;">As Dan Cuellar put it, this is remarkable for just putting in one year of work into it!</span></b></div><b></b><br /><div><b><b><br /></b></b></div><b></b><div><b><b>Sidenote:</b></b></div><b><br />What's a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app?&nbsp;</b></div><div><i>2/8/2017</i></div><div><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/whats-a-uwp" target="_blank"><i>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/whats-a-uwp</i></a><br /><br /><i>"The Universal Windows Platform (UWP) is the app platform for Windows 10. You can develop apps for UWP with just one API set, one app package, and one store to reach all Windows 10 devices – PC, tablet, phone, Xbox, HoloLens, Surface Hub and more. It’s easier to support a number of screen sizes, and also a variety of interaction models, whether it be touch, mouse and keyboard, a game controller, or a pen. At the core of UWP apps is the idea that users want their experiences to be mobile across ALL their devices, and&nbsp;they want to use whatever device is most convenient or productive for the task at hand.

In around three weeks, he was going to type up more detail to help users.<br /><br /><b>Want more?&nbsp;</b><br /><br />Dan will be giving a talk on the Selenium Conference in Austin, Texas on April 5, 2017.<br /><br /><b>What is XCode?</b><br /><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ide/" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ide/</a><br /><i><br /></i><i>"The Xcode IDE [Integrated Development Environment] is at the center of the Apple development experience. Tightly integrated with the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, Xcode is an incredibly productive environment for building apps for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV".</i><br /><h3>Appium has (yet another) (better) New GUI</h3><br />Note: The GUI is still in beta. Dan Graham, an Appium Developer from Sauce Labs Vancouver came up with a Appium Desktop app running on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can run it off of a server of your choosing, SauceLabs, or TestObject.<br /><br />The problem is that it takes so long for the Apple Simulator to load up. In the video above, Dan goes into a solution that Facebook came up with.<br /><br /><h3>How do you Speed Up Tests?</h3><br />1) <b>Avoid XPath. Xpath is slow</b>. Avoid using it where possible in Appium. If you do use it, use it it as a sub-search on a more quickly found element. There is a known problem is how the Appium team implemented it. They modelled it on exactness, not efficiency.<br /><br />2) <b>Implicit timeouts saves code but can slow down tests</b>. Use findElements that returns an array, and see if it is zero. Implicit checks that last 30 seconds and wait for elements.<br /><br /><br />... Those are all the notes I have! <br /><br /><h2>A Message from the Webinar's Sponsor: Sauce Labs</h2>And now, messages from this Webinar's sponsor, Sauce Labs, sent to me after the webinar, copied here for your enjoyment:<br /><br />"During his presentation, Dan referred to a presentation given by Lawrence Lomax at SeConf London that discussed ways to speed up testing on iOS simulators - you can access <a href="http://go.saucelabs.com/a0100t0b4X0n00pTVBVsdqX">the video here</a>.<br /><br />"Interested in Appium training?

Hope to see you at one or both events!"<br /><br />... I, myself, could never afford out-of-pocket Appium's prices for classes. There are so many great classes out there... well, basically pre-recorded video... but the cost is prohibitive. That's why I subscribe to Sauce Labs' blog &lt; <a href="https://saucelabs.com/blog" target="_blank">https://saucelabs.com/blog</a> &gt; so I can know of any free webinars, and attempt to footnote the free stuff.<br /><br />Happy Testing!<br /><br />-T.J.
