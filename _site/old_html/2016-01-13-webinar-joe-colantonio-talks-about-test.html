<h2>Test Automation Trends for 2016 and Beyond</h2><h3><b><i>Staying Employable In Changing Times</i></b></h3>Sauce Labs Webinar<br /><i>1/12/2016: 2:00 pm:&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Joe Colantonio, <a href="http://testtalks.com/">TestTalks.com</a></i><br /><br />Coding isn't the hard part of my role of being a brand-new automation engineer. Although I'm in my forties getting into development for the first time, I am actually doing okay -- in spite of always stressing out about the fact that grad school was a decade ago. I’ve now been writing automation scripts in Java and WebDriver for a year coming this March. Do anything for a year and you start becoming more comfortable with it. <br /><br />It's keeping up with the latest trends in automated software testing, now that is the hard part!<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />It was only a year ago that I had the nagging fear that because my sole knowledge base was manual testing, my entire software testing career was <i>dead, dead, dead</i>. This has since been replaced with other nagging fears: <i>Can I keep up with the industry standard</i>? Is what I am doing now the industry standard? <i>Is there, in fact, an automated testing industry standard</i>? I'm not privy to what other companies are doing. I’ve never worked as an automation developer for any other companies besides the one I am working for now. It is hard to plot out a graph with only a single point of data.<br /><br />That is why I was so excited to hear from the Sauce Labs mailing list that they would be hosting a webinar on test automation trends for 2016, to be given by Joe Colantonio from TestTalks.<br /><br />After doing a bit of research about the speaker, I was quite excited to hear what Joe had to say about software testing, and registered for the Sauce Labs Webinar immediately.<br /><h3><b><br /></b></h3><h3><b>About The Talk</b></h3><i>http://info.saucelabs.com/TestAutomationTrends2016_RegLP.html</i><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"Don't let your testing efforts fall behind — its time to get ready for the new year.

Testing Keeps Changing.&nbsp;</h3><br />On my blog, I've mentioned about <a href="https://www.blogger.com/www.tjmaher.com/2015/01/waterfall-qa.html" target="_blank">Waterfall + QA</a>, <a href="/2015/01/before-waterfall.html" target="_blank">Before Waterfall</a>&nbsp;and <a href="/2015/01/agile-software-development.html" target="_blank">Agile Software Development</a>.<br /><br /><b>Before</b>: Joe Colantonio pointed out, that with Waterfall, we were all siloed: From Business Analysts creating the requirements to Developers writing the code, to Testers / QA. It was a process in serial, slowly making its way from the left to the right.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.joecolantonio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WereAllTesters1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://www.joecolantonio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WereAllTesters1.png" height="294" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Joe Colantonio, <a href="http://www.joecolantonio.com/2015/11/03/were-all-testers-now/" target="_blank">We're All Testers Now</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><b>Now</b>: we are developer tests and ops / production.<br /><br /><b>&nbsp;In the Future</b>: DEV + Test + Ops will all be working together<br /><br />Joe quoted a guest on his show,&nbsp;<a href="http://gerrardconsulting.com/?q=blog" target="_blank">Paul Gerrard</a>, a software testing consultant who demoed at EuroSTAR 2015, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1coPQqo-8E" target="_blank">A New Model For Testing</a>":<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-large;">“Testing is not a role - its an activity with a deliverable.” -&nbsp;<i>Paul Gerrard</i></span></blockquote><br />... Whether the developer or tester is doing it, testing needs to be done.<br /><br /><h3>SHIFT +LEFT</h3>Mr.&nbsp;Colantonio introduced the new trend of "Shifting Left". With Waterfall, everything used to be siloed Business Analysts did their work, Developers did theirs, and Testers did theirs. With Agile work, there Job responsibilities had to shift... and they did. They shifted left. Everyone needs to be a tester. &nbsp;Testing is up front, not just at the end.<br /><br />I found another article explaining it further: <b>What is Shift Left Testing?</b><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"In the past, most traditional test automation focused on the UI and not the back-end. This was a leftover mindset from the days of 'just throw it over the wall'. With the current shift in how teams are organized, the skillset for testing is evolving. Dev/Ops, continuous delivery, mobile, cloud and the Internet of Things is forcing a rapid pace of development. Now, QA professionals and business analysts are more ingrained in the overall development process from start to finish. Now that software development for different platforms are using a 'shift-left' approach (which involves moving testing to earlier in the software development lifecycle), it is requiring test automation engineers to enhance their technical skills" <i>From <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/8653/145355">https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/8653/145355</a></i></blockquote><br />Mr. Colantonio mentioned other trends he had noticed were <i>Using DevOps principles,</i> and&nbsp;<i>Configuration Management Automation</i>&nbsp;with tools such as with <i>Chef</i> and <i>Puppet</i>. I did a bit of independent research on these terms:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>About Puppet:&nbsp;</b><a href="https://puppetlabs.com/about">https://puppetlabs.com/about</a></li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Puppet Labs is the leader in IT automation. Our software helps sysadmins automate configuration and management of machines and the software running on them. With our software, businesses can make rapid, repeatable changes and automatically enforce the consistency of systems and devices, across physical and virtual machines, on prem or in the cloud".</blockquote><ul><li><b>About Chef:&nbsp;</b><a href="https://www.chef.io/about/">https://www.chef.io/about/</a></li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq">"We are Chef. We are IT automation for speed and awesomeness. We give you a model for automating IT infrastructure and applications that drive self-reliance across your development and operations teams. We are the Chef Community. We are tens of thousands strong. We are helping your businesses become faster, safer and more flexible, so you win in today's 24x7 digital economy. Join our movement today".</blockquote><ul><li><b>About DevOps:&nbsp;</b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps</a></li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq">"DevOps (a clipped compound of "development" and "operations") is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. It aims at establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software, can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably. &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"[...] At the Agile 2008 conference, Andrew Clay Shafer and Patrick Debois discussed 'Agile Infrastructure'. The term 'DevOps' was popularized through a series of <i>devopsdays</i> starting in 2009 in Belgium. Since then, there have been <i>devopsdays</i> conferences held in many countries worldwide.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Tools such as Docker and Jenkins have automated more quality assurance processes and releases by development team. Puppet and automated configuration tools like Vagrant have also been used and frequently referenced in DevOps discussions."</blockquote><ul><li><b>About Continuous Integration</b>, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration" target="_blank">Thoughtworks</a>:&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Because you’re integrating so frequently, there is significantly less back-tracking to discover where things went wrong, so you can spend more time building features.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Continuous Integration is cheap. Not continuously integrating is costly. If you don’t follow a continuous approach, you’ll have longer periods between integrations. This makes it exponentially more difficult to find and fix problems. Such integration problems can easily knock a project off-schedule, or cause it to fail altogether".</blockquote><h3>Shift + Right</h3>Mr.&nbsp;Colantonio pointed out that not only is it Shift + Left, where everyone is a tester. It is is also Shift + Right, where everyone is a developer.<br /><br />Automation should be as fast as possible. Going through text based reports? Joe suggested writing python scripts to go through the reports.<br /><h3><br />Other Trends</h3><br /><b>TDD/BDD</b> 39%. We want to make sure that products and code wows our customers. Using behavior driven development should not be just an automation tool. It speaks about requirement as early as possible. When I ama user, I should go to the page and get this result. You can use an English syntax, and talk about the requirements.<br /><br /><ul><li><b>About Test Driven Development</b>, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming, begun in 1999, but more recently has created more general interest in its own right."</blockquote><ul><li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development" target="_blank">Behavior Driven Development</a>&nbsp;example</b>:</li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>Story</b>: Returns go to stock&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>In order to</b> keep track of stock&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">As a store owner<br />I want to add items back to stock when they're returned&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>Scenario 1</b>: Refunded items should be returned to stock<br />Given a customer previously bought a black sweater from me<br />And I currently have three black sweaters left in stock<br />When he returns the sweater for a refund<br />Then I should have four black sweaters in stock</blockquote><br />With TDD you need to get developers who love to test.<br /><br /><h3>Vendor Tools</h3><b><br /></b>Mr. Colantonio noted that&nbsp;<b>Selenium WebDriver</b> is THE tool that people are using, around 45%.<br />QTP / UFT (Quick Test Pro / &nbsp;Unified Functional Test): Only 10% are using. <i>Want more info?

Vendor Tools act as a wrapper around Selenium. These tools import the Selenium WebDriver API.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.joecolantonio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SeleniumVendorToolsMainImage.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://www.joecolantonio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SeleniumVendorToolsMainImage.png" height="286" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Joe Colantonio,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.joecolantonio.com/2015/11/17/selenium-and-vendor-based-tools/" style="font-size: 12.8px;" target="_blank">Selenium and Vendor Based Tools</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><b>About SmartBear TestComplete</b>: <a href="http://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/overview/">http://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/overview/</a></li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq">"TestComplete is a functional automated testing platform developed by SmartBear Software. TestComplete gives testers the ability to create automated tests for Microsoft Windows, Web, Android (operating system), and iOS applications. Tests can be recorded, scripted or manually created with keyword driven operations and used for automated playback and error logging. [...]&nbsp;TestComplete is broken out into three modules: Desktop, Web, Mobile [...]"</blockquote><ul><li><b>About HP LeanFT</b>: Press release <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=1998066#.VpXNqxUrK70" target="_blank">on June 2, 2015</a>:</li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Businesses today must act with speed and agility, and continuously capitalize on opportunities to deliver new solutions and experiences, business models, and revenue streams. In software development, this has fueled the rise of Agile methodology, which embraces a continuous delivery process, rather than a phased, sequential approach. For software testing, this means developers and testers seek to 'shift left,' and continuously test their applications much earlier in the application development lifecycle.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"HP LeanFT embraces the <b>shift left</b> concept by leveraging the key tools of the modern Agile developer ecosystem. Powerful, lightweight, and cost-effective, HP LeanFT is built specifically for continuous testing and continuous delivery, and fits naturally into existing ecosystems (such as Microsoft TFS, GIT, and Subversion) and frameworks that support test driven and behavior driven development".&nbsp;</blockquote><ul><li><b>Teller Test Studio</b>: <a href="http://www.telerik.com/teststudio">http://www.telerik.com/teststudio</a></li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Studio" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></i>: "Telerik Test Studio is a Windows-based software testing tool for web and desktop, functional testing, software performance testing,load testing and mobile application testing developed by Telerik. The tool ships with a plugin for Visual Studio and a standalone app that use the same repositories and file formats. Test Studio supports HTML, AJAX, Silverlight, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript and WPF. Test Studio supports test execution in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Chrome".</blockquote><br />Why all these vendor tools wrapping around Selenium? I had understood that the W3C is working on a <a href="/2015/12/new-editors-draft-of-w3c-webdriver.html" target="_blank">web driver standard</a>, but what I hadn't realize was that once web driver is a standard, all companies need to support it. Since WebDriver is nothing more than an API, other programs can use it, placing it in a user-friendly interface.<br /><br /><h3>Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Software Test Automation 2015</h3><br />If you are looking for industry standards, Joe Colantonio brought up The Gartner's Report, <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-2TXA7SZ&amp;ct=151211&amp;st=sg" target="_blank">Magic Quadrant for Software Test Automation 2015</a>:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://d1n3e8fpzha6ub.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/14100457/mq-graphic.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://d1n3e8fpzha6ub.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/14100457/mq-graphic.png" height="400" width="398" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-small; text-align: start;"><i>Gartner (December 2015)</i></span></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Companies and Toolsets mentioned in the report:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Testing Anywhere</b>, by Automation Anywhere&nbsp;</li><li><b>Silk Portfolio</b>, <b>Silk Mobile</b> and <b>Silk Central Connect</b>, by Borland, <i>now owned by Micro Focus.</i>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Hewlett Packard Enterprise</b>: <i>As of 1 November 2015, HP separated into two independent publicly traded companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc.</i></li><li><b>IBM Rational Suite</b></li><li><b>Oracle</b></li><li><b>Original Software</b></li><li>Progress <b>Telerik &nbsp;Test Studio</b></li><li>Ranorex</li><li>SmartBear <b>TestComplete</b></li><li><a href="http://www.testplant.com/news/testplant-recognized-as-a-visionary-in-gartners-magic-quadrant-for-software-test-automation/" target="_blank">TestPlant</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/tricentis-named-a-leader-in-gartner-2015-magic-quadrant-for-software-test-automation-2082064.htm" target="_blank">Tricentis</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.worksoft.com/press-releases/worksoft-recognized-leader-gartners-magic-quadrant-software-test-automation" target="_blank">Worksoft</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><br />... and there are a few more pages of notes that I need to transcribe...<br /><br />Thank you very much, Joe!
