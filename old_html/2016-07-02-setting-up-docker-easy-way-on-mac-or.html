<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Toolbox installer" height="300" src="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/images/toolbox-installer.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="400" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>It's the <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox" target="_blank">Docker Toolbox</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;Easy Installation!</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I've been on a quest since I became an automation developer, <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/07/blogging-about-automated-testing.html" target="_blank">documenting everything I have been doing</a> adding to the automated test framework at my workplace. Because I didn't start at square one, there are things I wonder about...<br /><br /><h2>The Past: Browser images on Virtual Machines</h2><br />When performing browser testing around a decade ago, I used to use VMWare to setup numerous virtual machine images for my testing team. The images contained the multitude of browsers and platforms configurations we needed. I would configure and place them the shared drive at whatever company I was working on. If we wanted to see how our web application looked on a clean install of the now defunct Netscape Navigator and Windows NT, and compare that with IE6, IE7, and IE8, our entire testing team could blow away whatever previous virtual machines they had on their desktop, and copy whatever was needed that day to their computer.<br /><br />I am on a quest to find that type of ease-of-use.<br /><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><h2>The Future: Browser images in Containers</h2><br />Although I haven't documented it in my blog, yet, it is easy to find tutorials to <a href="http://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-selenium-grid.html" target="_blank">download and install Selenium Grid</a>, which provides a small sample of browsers you can hook up your automated test framework to. My goal is to place my Selenium Grid in a Docker container, so that when automated testers are running automated tests on their local machine, they can set up the Docker image and have every browser and platform they need at their fingertips.<br /><br />A few months ago, we explored how to set up a virtual machine with <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/05/setting-up-virtual-dev-environment-with.html" target="_blank">VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Docker</a>. It would have been much too complex for someone just switching from manual testing to automated testing! Where could we find an easier way for someone to be able to dive in and set things up?<br /><br />We are going to be exploring the Docker Toolbox, a tool I heard about as I was <a href="https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2380/testing-as-a-container-using-docker-with-selenium-and-friends-to-ship-fast" target="_blank">listening to a video lecture</a> at Selenium Conf 2016.<br /><br /><h2>What Is a Docker Container?</h2><blockquote>"A container is an entire portable runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package. By containerizing the application platform and its dependencies ,all differences in OS distributions and underlying infrastructure are abstracted away which makes it easy to share and execute anywhere". <br /><i>-- Irfan Ahmad,&nbsp;<a href="https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2380/testing-as-a-container-using-docker-with-selenium-and-friends-to-ship-fast" target="_blank">Testing as a Container</a>: Using Docker with selenium and friends to ship fast</i></blockquote><h2>And What Is Docker, Again?</h2><br />Docker was created by Solomon Hykes while he was working at a company he founded,&nbsp;dotCloud. Docker was first released back in March 2013, written in the Google invented language called <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go</a>.<br /><br />The article <i><a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker" target="_blank">What is Docker</a>?</i> on Docker's official site mentions that "Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment".<br /><br /><h2>And What is a Container?</h2><br />Containers are lightweight: "Containers running on a single machine share the same operating system kernel; they start instantly and use less RAM. Images are constructed from layered filesystems and share common files, making disk usage and image downloads much more efficient".<br /><br />Containers are smaller than virtual machines: VMs "include the application, the necessary binaries and libraries, and an entire guest operating system -- all of which can amount to tens of" gigabytes. Containers "include the application and all of its dependencies --but share the kernel with other containers, running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system. Docker containers are not tied to any specific infrastructure: they run on any computer, on any infrastructure, and in any cloud".<br /><br />And, yes, <b>Docker has a GitHub site</b>:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">https://github.com/docker/docker</a><br /><blockquote>"Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest cloud compute instance and everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without depending on a particular stack or provider.<br /><br />"Docker began as an open-source implementation of the deployment engine which powered dotCloud, a popular Platform-as-a-Service. It benefits directly from the experience accumulated over several years of large-scale operation and support of hundreds of thousands of applications and databases".</blockquote><h2>The Docker Toolbox</h2>According to the <a href="http://docker%20machine%20for%20running%20docker-machine%20commands%20docker%20engine%20for%20running%20the%20docker%20commands%20docker%20compose%20for%20running%20the%20docker-compose%20commands%20kitematic%2C%20the%20docker%20gui%20a%20shell%20preconfigured%20for%20a%20docker%20command-line%20environment%20oracle%20virtualbox/" target="_blank">Docker Toolbox Overview</a>, the Docker Toolbox contains:<br /><ul><li>Docker Machine for running docker-machine commands</li><li>Docker Engine for running the docker commands</li><li>Docker Compose for running the docker-compose commands</li><li>Kitematic, the Docker GUI</li><li>a shell preconfigured for a Docker command-line environment</li><li>Oracle VirtualBox</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>... There is a GUI? Awesome! Don't tell anyone, but I really hate using the command line. It reminds me of working in a musty basement Mainframe computer lab during my undergrad program. Windows was a gigantic step towards the great user interface that Apple <a href="http://www.mac-history.net/computer-history/2012-03-22/apple-and-xerox-parc" target="_blank">already had stolen from Xerox years before</a>.<br /><br />You can go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox">https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox</a> to download the Docker Toolbox for the Mac or the PC. For the PC it downloads a simple executable file you can run.<br /><br />You can even go to the <a href="https://github.com/docker/toolbox" target="_blank">Docker Toolbox GitHub site </a>to see what is happening behind-the-scenes.<br /><br /><h2>Installing Docker Toolbox</h2><br />Okay... that's weird... I downloaded the tool, ran the executable, and as I was going through the installation process I saw an option that could be chosen during the installation:<br /><br /><ul><li><i>Install VirtualBox with NDIS5 driver [default NDIS6].&nbsp;</i></li></ul><br />What the what? For a a tool that is supposed to be easy, there needs to be a bit more user prompts to help a user to make a decision.<br /><br />After a bit of searching I found on <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html" target="_blank">VirtualBox's documentation</a>: ""The user is able to choose between NDIS5 and NDIS6 host network filters drivers during the installation. This is realized via a command line parameter NETWORKTYPE. The NDIS6 driver is default for Windows Vista and later. For older Windows versions, the installer will automatically select the NDIS5 driver and this cannot be changed. For Windows Vista and later the user can force to install the (legacy) NDIS5 host network filter driver using NETWORKTYPE=NDIS5".<br /><br />I'm going to leave that checkbox unchecked. I don't think I am going to need Windows 95, Win98, WinNT, or Windows ME. In case I do, I can set the parameters through the command line I can use either/ or:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><li><i>VirtualBox.exe -msiparams NETWORKTYPE=NDIS5</i></li><li><pre class="screen" style="background-color: white;"><i>msiexec /i VirtualBox-&lt;version&gt;-MultiArch_&lt;x86|amd64&gt;.msi NETWORKTYPE=NDIS5</i></pre></li><br />At the end of the process -- which seems to involve my copy of Git-SCM being uninstalled (Huh?) -- I have two icons in a folder: Docker Quickstart Terminal and Kitematic.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bxAuOwq6eO8/V3fUt0qpyFI/AAAAAAAALME/V176ccnPyBcZUzOM7bwhLNAou5zginDZQCLcB/s1600/icon.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="80" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bxAuOwq6eO8/V3fUt0qpyFI/AAAAAAAALME/V176ccnPyBcZUzOM7bwhLNAou5zginDZQCLcB/s320/icon.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Let's see what these buttons do: After double-clicking on the Docker Quickstart Terminal, five minutes later a terminal window appears:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qGCcl68aGPo/V3fVekPbLnI/AAAAAAAALMM/ebdby8rxsIoQ0SkNVrsgi6Tc6qhiJ2tRACLcB/s1600/whale.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="201" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qGCcl68aGPo/V3fVekPbLnI/AAAAAAAALMM/ebdby8rxsIoQ0SkNVrsgi6Tc6qhiJ2tRACLcB/s400/whale.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><ul><li>Hrm. That isn't too helpful. Let's type in <b>exit</b> to close the window.&nbsp;</li><li>When I start Kitematic, it says: "Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND docker.local docker.local:2375".

The container runs the instance of the image.<br /><br />When we ran "hello-world" the Docker Engine started and ran a Docker container, and attempted to run the hello-world image. Since we didn't have an image, it connected to the Docker Hub (&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.docker.com/">https://hub.docker.com</a>&nbsp;) and downloaded that image to the container.<br /><br />Since I eventually want to put Selenium Grid in a container, I might as well sign up for an account.
