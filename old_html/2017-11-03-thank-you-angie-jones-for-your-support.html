I can't remember how <a href="https://angiejones.tech/" target="_blank">Angie Jones</a> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/techgirl1908" target="_blank">@techgirl1908</a> )&nbsp;and I first connected two years ago. Did she stumble on my blog first? Or did I drop her a line on Twitter first? No matter.<br /><br />For the past couple of years, I've been an Angie Jones superfan.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VotJqV4n8ig" width="560"></iframe> <br />I've been loving how she has put herself out there for the software testing community, giving many <a href="https://angiejones.tech/category/talks/" target="_blank">unique automation talks</a> that I'd watch on YouTube, and then chat with about them with her on Twitter.<br /><br />And Angie's been reading this blog, <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/p/programming-projects.html" target="_blank">reviewing demo projects</a> I have been doing as I tried to re-learn coding after a ten year absence, always encouraging me to keep up the good work.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hhid6hmRH9A/Wfxf3dp4pNI/AAAAAAAAMHw/LcxQIyv8IRctwYM5GCfSqBpkNaECttqMwCLcBGAs/s1600/Angie%2BJones%2B-%2BLinkedIn%2Brecommendation.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="449" data-original-width="827" height="347" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hhid6hmRH9A/Wfxf3dp4pNI/AAAAAAAAMHw/LcxQIyv8IRctwYM5GCfSqBpkNaECttqMwCLcBGAs/s640/Angie%2BJones%2B-%2BLinkedIn%2Brecommendation.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Angie Jones' recommendation. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjmaher1/" target="_blank">View it on my profile at LinkedIn</a>!&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />When I needed a speaker at a Ministry of Testing - Boston Meetup event back in July 2017, <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2017/07/q-with-angie-jones-ministry-of-testing.html" target="_blank">she volunteered</a>, videoconferencing my group all the way from Twitter's San Francisco office. <br /><br />And when Twitter needed an automation developer, she thought of me, writing the most beautiful referral I have ever seen to her manager. I didn't get the position, but I did get two phone screenings, a coding test, and good exposure to a very interesting API testing tool. ( <a href="https://github.com/tjmaher/tinkeringWithTwitter" target="_blank">Click here to view a code sample</a> ).  <br /><br />After the interview process was complete, I asked Angie if she could post the referral she sent to her manager to my LinkedIn profile. She did.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"TJ has been testing for more than 20 years. With a greater demand for automation engineers, TJ self-taught himself about test automation. I have watched him in the industry over the last few years and he not only teaches himself, but he shares his knowledge with others via Github projects and blog posts. What's most admirable about him is he isn't a shallow learner. He goes deep and builds projects in his spare time to reinforce his learnings and ensure that he has practical experience in implementing these technologies. He is not afraid to continue to grow, in fact, he thrives on it. He would be an amazing asset to any team looking to enhance their automation efforts". - <a href="https://angiejones.tech/" target="_blank">Angie Jones</a></i></blockquote>Thank you, Angie, for your continued support! It is much appreciated!<br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
