<h3>From the Sauce Labs Blog:&nbsp;</h3>On Tuesday, August 25th at 11am PDT/2pm EDT Bill McGee, the Director of Marketing at Sauce Labs will be giving a Webinar called "Making the Transition from Manual to Automated Testing."<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"If you have been manually testing your Web application, making the transition to test automation can seem daunting. Where do you start, how do you determine what tests to automate and what tools do you use? These are questions that are at the top of the list for every first timer. Smoothing your transition to building test automation can be made easier with a little preparation and the right tools.</i>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"In this webinar we will discuss the key differences between manual and automated testing and provide tips to help you prepare for the transition.
