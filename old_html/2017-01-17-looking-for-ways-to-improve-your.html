The Ministry of Testing just announced a new product to help software testers improve their craft: They have distilled their collective wisdom down into the size of a deck of cards.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SWfVkiETH00/WH-HKn7lZBI/AAAAAAAALkE/TFFbD7RsPrkRqs2vRohP4C-MyVFh3-u8wCLcB/s1600/TestSphere-01_1024x1024.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SWfVkiETH00/WH-HKn7lZBI/AAAAAAAALkE/TFFbD7RsPrkRqs2vRohP4C-MyVFh3-u8wCLcB/s320/TestSphere-01_1024x1024.png" width="319" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><a href="https://store.ministryoftesting.com/collections/testsphere" target="_blank">Pre-order now</a>!
