Well, it looks like the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/" target="_blank">Ministry of Testing - Boston</a> isn't a small little group anymore.<br /><br />Yes, we have 800+ members, but those are just subscribers to our mailing list, not attendees. I would say we have 30 to 40 regular attendees, with me defining a "regular" as a person who attends one event every two months.<br /><br />Tonight, though, was different.<br /><br />Fifty of fifty-seven people who RSVPed "YES" actually attended&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/244512407/" target="_blank">Meet a Quality Coach @ Spotify</a>. Which is odd. Like most Meetups, we have a 50% attendance rate. With free events held right after work, with no penalty for skipping out after you signed up, the percentage of no-shows are high. With Ministry of Testing - Boston being in the vein of a work-related networking group, we get people who may just not have the energy to talk about work after spending the day at work.<br /><br />Today, the attendance rate was pretty close to 100%! It was quite unexpected.<br /><br />Where the heck did they all come from?<br /><br />After reviewing the logs, it looks like there was a huge spike in new membership a week before. Possibly they signed up just for the Spotify event?<br /><br />After a bit of searching, I found that the event really hit home with a lot of Boston event calendars.
