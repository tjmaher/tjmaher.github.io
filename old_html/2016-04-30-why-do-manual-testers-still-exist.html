In the April 28th edition of the <a href="http://sauceio.com/index.php/2016/04/why-is-manual-qa-still-so-prevalent/">Sauce Labs blog</a>, Joe Nolan ( <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeSolobx">@JoeSolobx</a> )  Mobile QA Team Manager and founder of the DC Software QA and Testing Meetup posted an article, "<a href="http://sauceio.com/index.php/2016/04/why-is-manual-qa-still-so-prevalent/">Why is Manual QA Still So Prevalent</a>?" In the article, Joe argues, "With the importance of catching bugs early, and the ability to automate all testing, why do companies and projects resist the investment in [Continuous Integration] and test automation?" and talks about an "automation first" strategy, building automation as the product is being built. <br /><br />Joe then list reasons why not all companies have embraced automation, such as:  <br /><ul><li>Management -- except for the QA Manager -- doesn't articulate support for automation</li><li>The development team hasn't giving the buy-in to be responsible for developing automation as they develop the product</li><li>The QA Analyst has trouble committing the time to learn automation, doesn't know where to start learning, and not given a chance to apply knowledge once learned. </li></ul>I agree with these points, especially the last one. After a long career as a Manual QA Engineer and a newly minted one as an Automation Developer, I don't know how I would have been able to manage in my new role -- although I was decade ago -- had I not finished grad school for software engineering.<br /><br />My problem with the article is that I believe a manual tester should <i>never</i> be obsolete!<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />A Manual QA resource embedded in the DEV team is not simply an extra pair of eyes on a project. Doing away with the role in a company is a tragic mistake, silencing the different mindset needed to make a successful product.<br /><br />My job as a software tester has always been to act as an end-user advocate. I provide a voice for customers of the web application that I am testing. After distilling both the product requirements and the user interface design into test cases, when I was a manual tester, I used to execute them using the same tools our customers will use: a keyboard, a mouse, or fingers on a touchscreen.<br /><br />A developer's main focus is building the thing. A QA Resource's job is understanding all the myriad ways that thing can be used by the customer, and writing exact steps to test it in kind. <br /><br />It takes -time- for automation to add their full value, and must be written, reviewed, and tested. Manual testers embedded in the team as the product is still in flux aren't just a stopgap measure. The work they do becomes the next automated test.<br /><br />- T.J.
