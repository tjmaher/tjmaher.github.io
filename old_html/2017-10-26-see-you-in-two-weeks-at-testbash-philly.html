Wow. I'll be attending my very first software testing conference in just two weeks! I can't wait!<br /><br /><ul><li>I'll be at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-philadelphia/events/241017262/" target="_blank">11/8/2017: Pre-TestBash Philadelphia Meetup</a></li><li>I am attending <a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/2017/05/testbash-philadelphia-2017-is-live/" target="_blank">TestBash Philly 2017</a>&nbsp;at FringeArts 11/9/2017 &amp; 11/10/2017</li><li>I'll be wrapping up at the 1<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-philadelphia/events/241017433/" target="_blank">1/10/2017: Post-TestBash Philadelphia Meetup</a></li></ul><br />If you see me around, wave me down and introduce yourself! Ignore the confused look on my face when you say hello, as I try to remember if I should know you already, went to college with you, or worked with you. And I apologize... it's going to take me a few times to have your name sink in.<br /><br />I'll be there with my little Chromebook, blogging away!<br /><br />See you there! I hear they still have 16 or so tickets available.<br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
