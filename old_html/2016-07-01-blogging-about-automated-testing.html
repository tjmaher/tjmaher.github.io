When I first started this blog, my undergrad and grad school degrees in computer science and software engineering were gathering dust! What a difference a few years makes.<br><br>This blog started way back when I was still trying to break into the automated testing field. It became more than that once I was hired at Fitbit-Boston, embedded in the team developing <b>automated test frameworks</b>. I started writing about:<br><ul><li>Setting up a development environment with <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/05/webdriver-development-environment-setup.html" target="_blank">IntelliJ /&nbsp;Maven</a>, then with IntelliJ / Gradle, then <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/06/webdriver-development-environment-setup.html" target="_blank">Eclipse / Gradle</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>Taking a <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/search/label/Gradle" target="_blank">deeper dive into Gradle</a>, exploring <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/06/building-test-framework-with-gradle.html" target="_blank">Groovy</a>, using it to run simple tests.</li><li>Using both <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/01/automate-amazon-sketch-of-possible-data.html" target="_blank">TestNG</a> and <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/06/webdriver-development-environment-setup.html" target="_blank">JUnit4</a>&nbsp;ways of making assertions. Suddenly, <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/05/webdriver-development-environment-setup.html" target="_blank">Hamcrest</a>.</li><li>Abstracting the page using the <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/search/label/Page%20Object" target="_blank">Page Object</a> model.</li><li>Using <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/04/how-selenium-webdriver-uses-css.html" target="_blank">CSS Selectors</a> to find and manipulate web elements on the page.</li><li>How to organize the web element selectors: first in <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/07/storing-locators-for-web-elements.html" target="_blank">enums</a>, then in By statements.</li><li><a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2015/12/automate-amazon-commonutils-methods-and.html" target="_blank">Wrapping Selenium calls</a>, placing them in a CommonUtils library.</li><li>Doing away with wrapping Selenium calls and just using <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/06/page-factories-setting-up-creating-them.html" target="_blank">Page Factory.</a></li><li>Performing API testing with Apache's <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/restful-testing-with-stripe-brief.html" target="_blank">HTTP Components</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/restful-testing-with-stripe-interacting.html" target="_blank">cURL</a>.</li><li>Passing data to tests using <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/01/automate-amazon-productenums-and.html" target="_blank">pojos</a> and <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/04/why-use-builder-pattern-examples-of.html" target="_blank">builder patterns</a>,</li><li>Showing examples of <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/02/do-you-actually-know-what-your.html" target="_blank">good logging</a> for tests.</li><li>Experiments with setting up a virtual dev environment with <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/05/setting-up-virtual-dev-environment-with.html" target="_blank">VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Docker</a>.</li><li>Coming up with various <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/p/programming-projects.html" target="_blank">programming projects</a>, and uploading the source code to <a href="https://github.com/tjmaher" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</li></ul>As a manual tester, I loved getting paid to explore and understand new technologies, see how they do (or don't) work. As an automated developer, there are so much more technologies to explore! <br><br><b>Selenium Conference 2016</b><div><br>Ugh! I always feel so far behind... <a href="http://2016.seleniumconf.in/" target="_blank">Selenium Conf 2016</a> happened in Bangalore, India back in 6/24/2016 to 6/26/2016, a whole four days ago, and I still haven't had any time to check out their schedule...<br><br>I love that they turn their schedule posted on the web as a way to archive the presenters videos and slides.&nbsp;<a href="https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/schedule">https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/schedule</a><br><br>What I am excited about is:<br><br><ul><li><a href="https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2307/grid-workshop" target="_blank">Selenium Grid Workshop</a></li><li><a href="https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2380/testing-as-a-container-using-docker-with-selenium-and-friends-to-ship-fast" target="_blank">Testing as a Container : Using Docker with selenium and friends to ship fast</a></li><li><a href="https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2519/cross-platform-multi-device-instant-communication-testing-in-parallel-using-appium-and-docker" target="_blank">Cross-platform, Multi-device Instant Communication Testing in Parallel using Appium and Docker</a></li></ul><br>This is exactly what I was looking for!<br><br>... I wonder if over the Fourth of July Weekend I can fit in a spare day to watch these videos, take notes, and turn them into new blog entries? <br><br>As always, Happy Testing! <br><br>-T.J.
