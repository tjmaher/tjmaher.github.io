I am happy to say that I have been made the co-organizer of the newly rebranded "Ministry of Testing - Boston" Meetup group, formerly the Greater Boston QA and Testing Meetup, at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston" target="_blank">https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston</a>. We are now under the <a href="http://www.ministryoftesting.com/" target="_blank">Ministry of Testing</a> umbrella.<br /><br />My first task as co-organizer? Try to find Ministry of Testing - Boston a home!<br /><br />Right now, the group is in the first year of its existence and is still in the nomadic stage. We always need to find a new location from month to month. In spite of this constant switching of locations, we do seem to get a high attendance rate of around 30 - 40 people per Meetup, with over 350 members. &nbsp;<br /><br />A friend of mine is checking to see if there is room at Google's Cambridge, MA office for our organization to meet once a month. If there isn't room, I need to find a back-up location!<br /><br />Leave me a message below, or say hello to me at Twitter at&nbsp;@tjmaher1.<br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
