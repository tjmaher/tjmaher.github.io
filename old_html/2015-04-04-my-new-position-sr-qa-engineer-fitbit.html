I cannot believe that as of today I have been at Fitbit - Boston for a whole month! I am a Senior QA Engineer getting ramped up with Selenium WebDriver / Java development. I have taken many online Selenium classes with Java and Python. I have spent six or seven months running automation scripts at my previous position, but this is the first job in my fifteen year manual software testing career where I am getting paid to professionally program... Exactly what I have been looking for! I am really excited. It is such a great company!<br /><div><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><h4>Related Links:&nbsp;</h4><div><ul><li>Have at least two years of Selenium / Java experience?

Developing the purchasing and order system. Altering and editing both the shopping cart customers use and the admin functionality the customer service representatives use. &nbsp;Verifying that the order fulfillment process doesn't have any hiccups. Tailoring the shopping cart for each and every country.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Fitbit doesn't use off-the-shelf software for their shopping cart. Everything is tailored specifically for their business. This means that a QA Engineer has to be aware of every part of creating an order, order processing, and the shipping process. Whether the Admins can create promo codes that can be used by our business partners. Whether taxes are calculated correctly for each state in the United States or every province in Canada. This means that deadlines are tight, bug fixing is critical, and testing is automated. And for automation, they use Selenium WebDriver.<br /><br />... And I have never been more happy! I am actually being trained in automated testing. I thought I was going to have to switch fields in order to get gainful employment!<br /><br />Here is part of our office's story as relayed by an internal HR Recruiter at Fitbit - Boston.
