To me, the most important metric to me is the <b>browser - platform matrix</b>. Since I consider the QA Engineer's primary goal is to operate a web application exactly as the customer base to see everything as they see it, I want to know what browsers and platforms are being used.<br /><br /><b>Google Analytics</b> showed me that from Saturday, October 21st to Friday, October 27th there were 1,176 user sessions. A "<i>session</i>", according to Google, is "the period of time a user is actively engaged in your website, app, etc".<br /><br />With these user sessions, the top ten browsers used were:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XX1QA1rKd9c/WfVIUr4bznI/AAAAAAAAMHY/A6LjosRD6R8H0bStLV1xHgbHoLtWK2qRQCLcBGAs/s1600/browser-stats.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="343" data-original-width="341" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XX1QA1rKd9c/WfVIUr4bznI/AAAAAAAAMHY/A6LjosRD6R8H0bStLV1xHgbHoLtWK2qRQCLcBGAs/s320/browser-stats.png" width="318" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Browser Stats: Top 10 Browsers</i></td></tr></tbody></table>This astonished me.<br /><br />I keep on thinking that maybe this week MS Edge usage will grow over time. But, no. It always seems to be Chrome &amp; Firefox which are the top two. They seem to make up 87% of all readers of this blog.<br /><br />As a software tester, I usually test in:<br /><br /><ul><li>Chrome, though I probably won't find many bugs using that browser since that seems to be most developer's favorite browser at the companies I have worked for.</li><li>Firefox, a few bugs may creep in, since fewer developers use that.</li><li>Internet Explorer 11, 10, and 9, depending on what the Product Owner wants. Working with healthcare companies or financial firms, you will see some old, old browsers</li><li>Safari on the Mac</li></ul>... I never get a chance to test on MS Edge, usually running out of time. I then get worried, checking the browser stats for the application I am testing on... and I find that it is always around two percent of the population.<br /><br />What ever happened to Microsoft's edge?<br /><br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
