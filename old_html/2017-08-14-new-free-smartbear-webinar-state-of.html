A few months ago, a sponsor of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/240191225/" target="_blank">Ministry of Testing - Boston</a>, SmartBear software, hosted a survey, "The State of Software Testing". Over five thousand people filled out the survey. The results are ready to be revealed! <br /><br />"Did you know that 63% of testers are responsible for testing both the frontend and backend of their applications? Or that API tests are more likely to be automated than GUI tests?<br /><br />"Discover what your peers are doing today in testing - the applications they’re building and the techniques they’re using. Learn more about modern test environments and how many teams are at the ‘tipping point’ of shifting left.<br /><br />"SmartBear collected insights from thousands of developers, testers, and managers worldwide who are passionate about software testing. They openly shared their experiences, insights, and the challenges they face in their day-to-day roles.<br /><br />"Join a panel of SmartBear experts as they walk through the 2017 ‘State of Testing Survey’ and divulge the key trends and observations we uncovered".<br /><br />Go to <a href="https://smartbear.com/resources/webinars/state-of-testing-2017">https://smartbear.com/resources/webinars/state-of-testing-2017</a> and register today!<br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
