I haven't had this much fun drafting this new slide deck since my student job as a Graphic Artist / Desktop Publisher back at Bridgewater State's Davis Alumni Center!<br /><br />Back then I loved helping organize events, plan promotional campaigns, draft flyers, create T-Shirts and logos, plaster flyers I designed all around campus, and volunteer to set up chairs and join the student ushers.<br /><br />I never spoke at these events. I may have been a Computer Science Major / Theater Minor, but when I was on-stage, I was safely in the middle of the chorus as a performer, or backstage where my crippling stage-fright wouldn't kick in. I may have been able to goof around on stage in cute community theater productions in elementary school and junior high, but when I was in high-school competing for parts with budding professionals, I knew where my true talents lie.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I am pretty comfortable giving end-of-sprint product demos, no matter how many people are in the room. Let me have my cue-cards so I can keep the talk tight and on-track, and I am fine. Oh, I might need to spend a few years working through <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Toastmasters-MIT/events/234456314/" target="_blank">Toastmasters</a> before I am anywhere near TED Talk standards.<br /><br />My slide deck should be finished in the next day or two. I have a rough script for the 30 minute talk that I will go over twenty or thirty times in the next week. I know the material, first living it and then organizing the information to create the <a href="http://techbeacon.com/how-pass-coding-interview-automation-developer" target="_blank">article on which the talk is based</a>. I think I will do fine...<br /><br />What do you think of the draft of the cover page and the title page? Leave your comments below!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iZod58fBwTo/V_Z4xh_E0aI/AAAAAAAALe8/z3wHk_NOZec0OAOeMJXUZNBFuwXWDjEhgCLcB/s1600/cover.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="296" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iZod58fBwTo/V_Z4xh_E0aI/AAAAAAAALe8/z3wHk_NOZec0OAOeMJXUZNBFuwXWDjEhgCLcB/s400/cover.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Draft: Cover Page</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0b73Uz46TgM/V_Z5CdyFc9I/AAAAAAAALfA/xiUTCfJTH9QABuNm_Q1Xe6Om4q5e2A6dQCLcB/s1600/title.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0b73Uz46TgM/V_Z5CdyFc9I/AAAAAAAALfA/xiUTCfJTH9QABuNm_Q1Xe6Om4q5e2A6dQCLcB/s400/title.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Draft: About the Speaker page</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />... This Speaker Page was for people who are reading along at home, after the fact on <b>Slideshare</b> at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tjmaher1" target="_blank">http://www.slideshare.net/tjmaher1</a>.<br /><br />I was going to upload the slides to my Slideshare account before the lecture.<br /><br /><ul><li>Mention to the audience when I reach this page that these slides are stored on Slideshare.net/tjmaher1. They can enjoy the lecture and don't need to take notes if they don't wish to.&nbsp;</li></ul><br />Hrm... I think "About the Speaker" and "About the Talk" should go on two separate pages. Thank you&nbsp;Gustavo Adolfo Rivera Yeomans!<br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you very much!<br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
