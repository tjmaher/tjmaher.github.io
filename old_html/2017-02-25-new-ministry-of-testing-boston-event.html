<div><b>From the Ministry of Testing - Boston website:</b></div><div><a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/237975761/" target="_blank">https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/237975761/</a></div><div><br /></div>"Description: With the increasing popularity of both mobile applications and Apple hardware, Quality Assurance (QA) professionals are being asked more and more to test native iOS applications. Automated User Interface (UI) testing continues to grow in popularity and can help save time, money, and eliminate human error in the testing process.<br /><div><br /></div><div>"Apple’s XCTest provides a robust UI testing framework that allows a QA professional to automate most actions a user would perform on a mobile device. With convenient features such as UI recording and the option to write tests in the feature-rich Swift programming language, this framework is a popular and solid choice. Using the case example of an ongoing iPad app build, we will explore how QA professionals can use this framework to build a comprehensive testing suite and touch upon some of the plumbing/DevOps associated with getting up and running and automating aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)". <br /><br />Sign up <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/237975761/" target="_blank">here</a>!<br /><br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
