Two things I have always enjoyed: Writing and storytelling.<br /><br />I've been into writing and storytelling ever since elementary school and junior high, when I was the neighborhood Dungeon Master. Seeing that first scene in Stranger Things certainly took me back!<br /><br /><b><u>Stranger Things | The First 8 Minutes</u></b><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKtq-bZgS8I" width="560"></iframe> <br /><br />I’ve always loved my creative writing classes in high school and college. I miss it. I write for this <a href="http://www.tjmaher.com/" target="_blank">software testing blog</a>, I write articles for <a href="http://techbeacon.com/contributors/thomas-maher" target="_blank">TechBeacon</a>, and tech writing on-the-job, but it is not the same thing.<br /><br />Back in college, I started merging computers with creative writing in various online communities. There was MicroMUSE and MariMUSE, which allowed people to create little Zork-like text based adventures. &nbsp;I spent many an hours at Bridgewater State College’s basement computer lab writing out scenarios based on Edgar Allan Poe's Cask of Amontillado and MS Found in a Bottle.<br /><br />https://aeon.co/essays/before-minecraft-or-snapchat-there-was-micromuse<br /><br />Attempting to set up shop in web design I participated in WCA Web Consultants Association, Web Sociology group WebSocks<br /><br />Favorite writing adventure: Selling shirts on trade-chat of a World of Warcraft PvP server #AltarOfStorms as “Gregori, the Dwarven Tailor”. &nbsp; &lt;Made By Gregori&gt;<br /><br />I was addicted to World of Warcraft back in 2006 for a bit over two years as I was trying to finish up my MSE from Brandeis. It’s how I socialized with a friend who had moved out-of-state.<br /><br />WOW Role Playing character concept: Dwarf hunter looks like Gregori Rasputin? Call him “Gregori”. Problem: RP did not fly on the AoS PvP server. Oh... I was hunted by Horde. <br /><br />I’d go on the Altar of Storms game forums, write about my love of WOW, and the Horde would hunt me, camp me and /wave.<br /><br />Since I was trapped in the Alliance towns anyway, why not sell goods in trade chat? I’d come up with little jingles to sell my wares.<br /><br />WOW AoS Trade Chat: [Gregori]: "One shirt, two shirt! Red shirt, blue shirt! Buy your &lt;Made By Gregori&gt; shirt at the Auction House!"<br /><br />WOW #AoS Trade Chat: [Gregori]: “Be the sharpest ‘lock on your block! Buy your &lt;Made By Gregori&gt; shirt at the Auction House!"<br /><br />Oddly enough, the shirts were a hit! I had Horde players jump on a friend’s account asking me to sell ‘em at the neutral Auction House.<br /><br />The Horde still hunted me and camped me when I ventured outside of town … but this time they threw in a /hug every now and then.<br /><br />The Nerd Fun - Boston Meetup replaced WOW. I’d find cool lectures historical, scientific, and technological, heavily research them, and publish my notes in the event description.<br /><br />I grouped up herds of nerds five days a week from 2008 to 2010. That’s how I met my wife!<br /><br />My wife is #StarTrek. I am more #StarWars. It is a mixed marriage.<br /><div><br /></div><br />-T.J.
