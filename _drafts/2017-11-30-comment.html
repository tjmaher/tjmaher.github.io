<div>Fifty people from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ministry-of-testing-boston/events/244512407/" target="_blank">the Ministry of Testing - Boston</a>&nbsp;came out to Spotify's Davis Square, Somerville, MA office on Tuesday, November 28th to listen to Chris Phair talk about&nbsp;<b>WTF is a Quality Coach?</b>&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Although Chris Phair has been a Spotify Quality Coach for seven months, he has been in the Quality Assurance field for the past twelve years: Nuance for 8 years, and Fitbit -- where I first met Chris -- for two years.<br /><br /></div><a href="http://spotify.com/" target="_blank">Spotify</a> has a rather unique organizational structure as described in Harvard Business Review's <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/02/how-spotify-balances-employee-autonomy-and-accountability" target="_blank">How Spotify Balances Employee Autonomy and Accountability</a>,&nbsp;consisting of self-organizing squads, tribes, and guilds.<br /><div><br /></div><div>But what about QA Engineers? What about the software testers?</div><div><br /></div><div>Spotify doesn't have any.<br /><br />As Chris put it, instead of testing being an activity of a few, testing is everybody's job. And to help... they have a Quality Coach that trains and mentors teams to take ownership of the quality process.<br /><br />Snapshot of Spotify:&nbsp;<br /><div><br /><br /></div><div><br /><br /><br /><br />Spotify.  <br />Daniel cek, lawenson. Time of Napster. Daniel had upbringing in music. Thought aritst getting screwed. Artist fairly compensated. Fare wage.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />2008: first desktop<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />2009 <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />2011: 1 imllion paid subscribers. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Currently x employees.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />July 2017: 60 million paid subscribvers.<br /><br />Daily active users: 140 million<br /><br />Number of playlists 2 billion playlists.<br /><br />number of somngs: 30 million<br /><br />Revinue paod to rightsholders: 5 billion Sept 2016<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Squad: Tribe” Chapter. Guild. <br /><br />(See slide)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Not every squad is the same. Self directred<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Tribe: collection of squads. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Missions: Long turn goals, asperations and beliefs/ <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Rolls Royce Voice: Voice offereinf to customer. Belows to a tribe called quest (experiennts and small studies). <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Mission: User engagement trying to make a platform that engages the user and <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Guilds: Domain specific communities. OS guild. Machien learning guild. Chris as a quality coach can  learn. Meet at Un conferences. Fun useful way to share knowledge.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Chapters: Reporting struction usch as a c qualtiy structure lead. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Chris’s quality philosophy. Collecte a lot of data points. <br /><br />“Quality is not an act, it is a habit”. Aristotler. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Firm believe r that is not a function of a QA team. Sustainable quality requires a team commitmenet. Qualtiy isa first class passenger. Handoffs from DEV to QA misses the mark. It is a broken model that never seems to work for him <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Better: Feature team: QA is embedded in the dev team in the sprint. Bunch of developers dumps it on QA. (I call this two week waterfall). <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />What works for him: a real team commitment to quality, design, engineering takes pride and ownership with what they are doing.  The team knows quality. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Chris has heard developers say “I don’t test”. How do you know if it works then?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Spotify also beoievs this. No dedicated tea,. Qualtiy Coaches. Some SDET spattered around. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />“Quality mindset helps drive best practices”. Spotify believes at “quality at speed”.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />To win in this space, they need to be fast AND maintain good quality standards. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why a quality coach. Brings a quality mindset. QA has a different mindset. Brings a new perspective to the table. Havign a quality if he overhears developers say “we can just bang this out”coach.. “Do we need an end to end test’.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />What is a quality coach<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Not a dedicated tester<br /><br />He hates the word manual testing<br /><br />Not a gatekeeper. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />He is a quality ambassador in the tribe. He is a tribe resource. Always be there to help answer questions about quality. Not to pass judgement, but to spur conversation working with the team. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />He works on many squads. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Communication liason. He works on quality inityiatives all actrodss the company. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />NYC-Infra, IOS-Infra, Release squads, quality guids, etc. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />He is shuttling information from teams to the quality guild and back again. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The squad determines what tools and technolgoies to use. There is no unified QA or tests set up. There are suggestions… but they don’t dictate. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />“Are there a lot of reinventing wheels?”<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />“Yes, there are a lot of reinventing wheels”.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />“How many teams are you responsible for?”<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />“I’m not responsible for any of them”. It all depends on the squad. <br /><br />Sets individual quality goals. Get the group to agree with them. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />There is a large overlap between Agile Coach and Quality  Coach. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Facilityate, rather than dictate. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Example: Espresso is a tool there. Chris loves it, advocates it, demos the framework, but no team needs to adopt what he does. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Jermey, works with Chris: This mauy ound like the wild west, but there is a process. Part of radical autonomy is radical ownershiop. It’s not the Ops team qwho will get a midnight call. It is the team itself on rotation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Every feature has a feature flag that can be turn the feature off if things go sidewides<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Chris goes to retros, planning sessions. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />How to decide which squad to focus on? “Jermemy: It;s a coaching model. You see how many leaks are in your bucket and you patch them up.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />New squads need more help. Put process es in palace. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Chris’s Focus areas: Product quality, code quality, and proces quality, <br /><br />Product quality: end users perception, testign practices for end users for manual testing. Testign structure needs to be in place. They have “test swarms” Q, liek a “bug bash”, once a week to test features. some scripted regression testing. some exploratorry testing.But if he has done his job, there would be also automated tests.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Chris woudl come up with a coaching model: watch, observe, then analyze later what hesaw. Came up with a list on ways to improve test swarms. Present it, forst to get feedback, then to get buy in.. this process is owned by the squad. Onb;y they can choose to adopt it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Observe<br /><br />Make suggestions’<br /><br />Ask for feedback<br /><br />Get buy in<br /><br />The team owns it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Code Quality<br /><br />Test certification framework in place. Encourages everyone to write user tests at the lowest levels, and simple end-to-end tests. “Should we use automated testing’. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Manages technical debt. Often times technical debt is “super sneaky”. You don’t know you made bad decisions until later. If the team agewes, it is scoped out, but in the backlog, and tackled at a later date. Technical debt, gettign the team aware and always thinking about it. teackk it, sto make sure that you tacke iut. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Procerss quality.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lot of overlap with Agile coaches. Squads can pick any way they want to use.. trello, jira, physical boards. The team picks the process they want to use.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Regualr bug triages. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay / not okay dcument. “Oknok document” for features. Squad level  call. Anything that happens that effects end users, incidient repotts. Does a post moretem. If something blows up, log it right away, tag teams. I to I process, incident to incidfent process.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />It is important to manage sped and quality. He tried to se tthe bar as posible but in reality that process will slow you down. The team sets the bar at certain level. Do A / B tests, get feedback, have reaseah look at it and design to redesign it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sprints are two weeks. It will take two weeks to get your learnings. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Bumper sticker: Less testing, more learning. Probably dealing with schooling, but it fits. He took the picture while driving. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />When things <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
