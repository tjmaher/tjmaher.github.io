Let me tell you, I hate reading documentation on my computer screen. It's the glare. It strains the eye. That's why I really love my old Kindle Paperwhite. It's portable like a book, but much thinner than a bulky textbook.<br /><br />Since I am brand new to testing on Amazon Web Services, I was looking for answers to questions such as "What is DevOps"? To "What is AWS"? And "How Do You Make It Secure?"<br /><br />To answer the DevOps questions, I purchased:<br /><br /><ul><li>Jez Humble and David Farley's "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912" target="_blank">Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation</a>"</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002" target="_blank">The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations</a></li><li>Katrina Cloakie's "<a href="https://leanpub.com/testingindevops" target="_blank">A Practical Guide to Testing in DevOps</a>" from LeanPub.</li></ul><br />But which books should I get to learn Amazon Web Services? The most up to date information is already on their tutorials in&nbsp;<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/Documentation" target="_blank">AWS.Amazon.Com/Documentation</a>.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that all documents on the web can be accessed in Kindle form, and all of them for free!<br /><br />... Though it stands to reason that the online service that upended the bookstore business model would have all their technical books on their eReader platform.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Happy Testing! <br /><br />-T.J.
